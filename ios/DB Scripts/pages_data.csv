However, no single variable deteriorates at a uniform rate in all patients. Therefore, multiple clinical parameters are required to judge the progression of ALS.
Although ALS usually presents in a localized anatomical area, the location of initial presentation does not correlate with survival time. By the time patients become end-stage, muscle denervation has become widespread, affecting all areas of the body, and initial predominance patterns do not persist.
Progression of disease differs markedly from patient to patient. Some patients decline rapidly and die quickly; others progress more slowly. For this reason, the history of the rate of progression in individual patients is important to obtain to predict prognosis.
In end-stage ALS, two factors are critical in determining prognosis: ability to breathe, and to a lesser extent ability to swallow. The former can be managed by artificial ventilation, and the latter by gastrostomy or other artificial feeding, unless the patient has recurrent aspiration pneumonia. While not necessarily a contraindication to hospice care, the decision to institute either artificial ventilation or artificial feeding will significantly alter six month prognosis.

Choices for care are based on diagnosis and prognosis, potential benefits/risks of various therapies, personal priorities. Things a person would like to do both in the outside world and personally guides how (s)he would possibly like physicians to address illness. Clarification of goals of care directs recommendations (for medical treatment, surgical interventions, intensity of care). Stimulating this discussion in the ED, even without resolution, can positively impact patient care. Without a roadmap first, you can waste time heading down a wrong direction. Possible goals include prevention, cure, prolongation of life, achieving a good death. No one is inherently most valid, and multiple goals may be simultaneous, but they do inherently interrelate and change. In general, reversing illness and restoring health doesn?t preclude goals of relieving suffering and improving quality of life. The 7-step process can be used at any time during a person?s illness trajectory. You need certain clinical skills to negotiate goals. Skills for the EP include identifying what is reasonable hope? conveying prognosis (with its uncertainty) using appropriate language, setting limits as needed, managing care if patient lacks decision-making capacity (within norms of patient?s culture.) Recognize that ED visits often indicate deterioration of long-standing illness or identification of new dz. new events and changes can cause pt to alter prev goals of care.",,0,

54,51,Possible Goals For the emergency physician,,0,"communicate prognosis and its uncertainty
use language that effectively communicates, negotiates? 
set limits on unreasonable goals? (e.g. a patient has incurable disease as well as unrealistic hopes for cure)
adjust care and communication according to patient?s culture? 
meet expectations for treatment and respect and follow personal instructions and decisions to avoid pt[?s family] getting angry, losing trust in medical team. 
avoid unwanted treatments (?What is purpose of performing tests or procedures on this pt?""; ?How will information influence treatment??)
avoid inappropriate use of resources (?labs, rad, invasive tests will reveal multiple abnormalities warranting acute hospitalization, but when presented with this info, pt[?s fam] respond, ?We just want to go home.?; ask: ""What are we hoping to find, and what will I do w/ info??)
prevent undue suffering (?Can info or procedure change outcome??)
dissipate miscommunication among patient, caregiver, and clinician. 
Understand that curative and palliative goals can coexist--allowing for some treatments to continue rather than change goals and that multiple goals are more common than a single goal. 
A patient?s overriding goal may be prolonging life, yet (s)he may also have the goal of avoiding increases in discomfort. The clinicial may know a surgery or chemotherapy, may unintentionally cause temporary or permanent functional deterioration and suffering. It is our duty to help the patient and family understand a balance between benefits and burdens of a particular treatment. Over the course of an illness, the relative weight given to each goal may change. It is only in the context of an individual?s life and current situation that a balance of goals is achieved. Clinical decisions require prioritization among potential contradictions. Such tradeoffs are inevitable and are part of a continuum of medical care. Goals of care and treatment priorities frequently change as patients approach the end of life. An abrupt transition from primarily curative care to primarily palliative care is rarely appropriate, but historically common. integrating goals of care gradually, not dichotomously. important for progressive predictably fatal illnesses (eg, most cancers, AIDS, COPD, CHF, DM, CRF/ESRD), as treatment changes natural course and prolongs life, but doesn?t cure. Integrate relief of suffering into continuum of care. 
 Realize when the dying patient is a child, a parent?s realization of prognosis comes late. Multiple goal setting may be particularly common in pediatric or younger patients where the concept of ?giving in? to death can be particularly overwhelming.
be culturally aware: 
in general don?t apply cultural generalizations to individuals
ask pt early on preference for your handling of info and who they want to make decisions

How do I communicate prognosis + its uncertainty
Never assume px has not been delivered; assume patient did not hear/understand
Provide prognostic data using a range ( ?Although I can?t give you an exact time, given your illness and condition I believe you have [hours to days]. this is an average, some live longer and some live shorter.?)
Summarize a big picture in few sentences-use ?dying? if appropriate. ?I?m afraid I have some bad news. I wish things were different. based on what you have told me, and what I see, I believe your mother is dying.?
Avoid jargon and organ-by-organ medical review. 
Avoid phrases like ?do everything? (language with unintended consequences, e.g. [the medical community] will do nothing and abandon you.)

?People who expect to have months left to live may set a goal of trying treatments that may prolong life, but stopping the treatments if they are not working so that the burden is not too great.?
?People facing only weeks to live often aim for quality of life and noninvasive interventions only.?
?People close to death often ask for care that secures comfort and does not aim to prolong life.?

Is this acceptable/ok??; ?All dying patients lose thier interest in eating in the days to weeks leading up to death; this is the body?s signal that death is coming.?; I am recommending that the (tube feeding, IVF) be discontinued (or not started) as these will not improve her living and may only prolong her dying.?
Regarding CPR in a patient with terminal illness: Based on what you see on television, I know that it seems that most patients who get CPR live, but this is not the case. We only start CPR at the moment of death and it is an attempt to reverse the moment of death. The vast majority of patients who get CPR will not have death reversed. I would only recommend that for you if I thought you were in the group of patients who survive to go home. Unfortunately, because of your severe heart failure, I would not recommend it.
Regarding Mechanical Ventilation: When a patient gets ill enough to require an artificial machine to breath, we have to weigh the chance of the patient being strong enough to get off of the machine. In your case of severe lung cancer, you are already very weak and we know that such patients are not able to come off the machine. This would result in you dying while on the machine. This is not consistent with what you have told me about wanting to die at home.",,0,
