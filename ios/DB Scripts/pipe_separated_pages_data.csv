Certain clinical factors inc predictive value of estimated length of survival when used with performance status. In one small prospective study, for example, it was demonstrated that there was a significant relationship between length of survival and dysphagia, cognitive failure and weight loss. The presence of all three factors – weight loss of 10 kg or more, MMSE of < 24, and dysphagia to solids or liquids predicted survival of less than 4 weeks with an accuracy of 74 %.

Begin at the left column and read downwards until the appropriate ambulation level is reached, then read across to the next column and downwards again until the activity/evidence of disease is located. Repeat until all five columns are covered before assigning the actual PPS for that patient. In this way, 'leftward' columns (columns to the left of any specific column) are 'stronger' determinants and generally take precedence over others. 		 	 	 
	
PPS scores are in 10% increments only. Sometimes, there are several columns easily placed at one level but one or two which seem better at a higher or lower level. One then needs to make a 'best fit' decision. Choosing a 'half-fit' value of PPS 45%, for example, is not correct. The combination of clinical judgment and 'leftward precedence' is used to determine whether 40% or 50% is the more accurate score for that patient. PPS may be used for several purposes. First, it is an excellent communication tool for quickly describing a patient's current functional level. Second, it may have value in criteria for workload assessment or other measurements and comparisons. Finally, it appears to have prognostic value. "||0

47|46|Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis general considerations|0|"   1. ALS tends to progress in a linear fashion over time. Thus the overall rate of decline in each patient is fairly constant and predictable, unlike many other non-cancer diseases.
   2. However, no single variable deteriorates at a uniform rate in all patients. Therefore, multiple clinical parameters are required to judge the progression of ALS.
   3. Although ALS usually presents in a localized anatomical area, the location of initial presentation does not correlate with survival time. By the time patients become end-stage, muscle denervation has become widespread, affecting all areas of the body, and initial predominance patterns do not persist.
   4. Progression of disease differs markedly from patient to patient. Some patients decline rapidly and die quickly; others progress more slowly. For this reason, the history of the rate of progression in individual patients is important to obtain to predict prognosis.
   5. In end-stage ALS, two factors are critical in determining prognosis: ability to breathe, and to a lesser extent ability to swallow. The former can be managed by artificial ventilation, and the latter by gastrostomy or other artificial feeding, unless the patient has recurrent aspiration pneumonia. While not necessarily a contraindication to hospice care, the decision to institute either artificial ventilation or artificial feeding will significantly alter six month prognosis.

54|53|Goals of Care in the ED|0||Almost every cognizant person has a sense of self, what (s)he tries to do, how (s)he determines and relates to events, and what (s)he hopes for. People usually developed a sense what brings meaning, value, and adds most to quality of life.  Choices depend on experiences, goals, expectations of future.  goals change over the course of a life. At 1 time or another, many people will confront significant illness and consider the possibility death. Choices for care are based on diagnosis and prognosis, potential benefits/risks of various therapies, personal priorities. Things a person would like to do both in the outside world and personally guides how (s)he would possibly like physicians to address illness. Clarification of goals of care directs recommendations (for medical treatment, surgical interventions, intensity of care). Stimulating this discussion in the ED, even without resolution, can positively impact patient care. Without a roadmap first, you can waste time heading down a wrong direction. Possible goals include prevention, cure, prolongation of life, achieving a good death. No one is inherently most valid, and multiple goals may be simultaneous, but they do inherently interrelate and change. In general, reversing illness and restoring health doesn't preclude goals of relieving suffering and improving quality of life. The 7-step process can be used at any time during a person's illness trajectory. You need certain clinical skills to negotiate goals. Skills for the EP include identifying what is reasonable hope? conveying prognosis (with its uncertainty) using appropriate language, setting limits as needed, managing care if patient lacks decision-making capacity (within norms of patient's culture.) Recognize that ED visits often indicate deterioration of long-standing illness or identification of new dz. new events and changes can cause pt to alter prev goals of care.||0

   2. Use language that effectively communicates, negotiates? 
   3. Set limits on unreasonable goals? (e.g. a patient has incurable disease as well as unrealistic hopes for cure)
   4. Adjust care and communication according to patient's culture? 
   5. Meet expectations for treatment and respect and follow personal instructions and decisions to avoid pt['s family] getting angry, losing trust in medical team. 
   6. Avoid unwanted treatments (''What is purpose of performing tests or procedures on this pt?""; ''How will information influence treatment?'')
   7. Avoid inappropriate use of resources (''labs, rad, invasive tests will reveal multiple abnormalities warranting acute hospitalization, but when presented with this info, pt['s fam] respond, ''We just want to go home.''; ask: ""What are we hoping to find, and what will I do w/ info?'')
   8. Prevent undue suffering (''Can info or procedure change outcome?'')
   9. Dissipate miscommunication among patient, caregiver, and clinician. 
   10. Understand that curative and palliative goals can coexist--allowing for some treatments to continue rather than change goals and that multiple goals are more common than a single goal. 
   11.  Realize when the dying patient is a child, a parent's realization of prognosis comes late. Multiple goal setting may be particularly common in pediatric or younger patients where the concept of ''giving in'' to death can be particularly overwhelming.
   12. Be culturally aware: 
      1. In general don't apply cultural generalizations to individuals
      2. Ask pt early on preference for your handling of info and who they want to make decisions
      3. Discuss if feasible to get all parties together w/in ED visit, in family meeting so all can hear the patient's disposition
      4. Some cultures prefer medical info, particularly that of a life-threatening px, be given to family not patient. Some Navajos do not want a negative prospect at all
      5. Use 3rd person. e.g. ''If you were hearing a story about someone who was facing an illness that could not be cured, how would you want that story to describe the best way to help?''"|Understand that curative and palliative goals can coexist - A patient's overriding goal may be prolonging life, yet (s)he may also have the goal of avoiding increases in discomfort. The clinicial may know a surgery or chemotherapy, may unintentionally cause temporary or permanent functional deterioration and suffering. It is our duty to help the patient and family understand a balance between benefits and burdens of a particular treatment. Over the course of an illness, the relative weight given to each goal may change. It is only in the context of an individual's life and current situation that a balance of goals is achieved. Clinical decisions require prioritization among potential contradictions. Such tradeoffs are inevitable and are part of a continuum of medical care. Goals of care and treatment priorities frequently change as patients approach the end of life. An abrupt transition from primarily curative care to primarily palliative care is rarely appropriate, but historically common. integrating goals of care gradually, not dichotomously. important for progressive predictably fatal illnesses (eg, most cancers, AIDS, COPD, CHF, DM, CRF/ESRD), as treatment changes natural course and prolongs life, but doesn't cure.

   2. Regarding CPR in a patient with terminal illness: Based on what you see on television, I know that it seems that most patients who get CPR live, but this is not the case. We only start CPR at the moment of death and it is an attempt to reverse the moment of death. The vast majority of patients who get CPR will not have death reversed. I would only recommend that for you if I thought you were in the group of patients who survive to go home. Unfortunately, because of your severe heart failure, I would not recommend it.
   3. Regarding Mechanical Ventilation: When a patient gets ill enough to require an artificial machine to breath, we have to weigh the chance of the patient being strong enough to get off of the machine. In your case of severe lung cancer, you are already very weak and we know that such patients are not able to come off the machine. This would result in you dying while on the machine.

66|2|Who needs a palliative care consult?|0||||0
67|66|Global Trajectories|0||Palliative care recognizes 4 paradigm clinical situations.  These should become mental prompts for EP to place pt on appropriate global trajectory. Unlike hospice, palliative care is available at any stage of a life-threatening/serious illness, and is especially helpful to those who wish to continue the pursuit of curative or aggressive care while still receiving optimal symptom control and psychosocial support. Palliative care services focus on goals of care, coordination of care, and aggressive symptom management. Palliative medicine practitioners generally have more time to spend at bedside than ED providers and have expertise with drug dosing/combinations for symptom management which may be unfamiliar to ED or other consults. Early use of palliative care services has demonstrated (1) reduction in length of stay; (2) change of bed assignment based on acuity in order to improve quality care; (3) improved symptom control scores; and (4) increased patient satisfaction. Some ED presentations that might benefit from a palliative care team consult in the ED include: acute stroke in patient with advanced Parkinson's disease; urosepsis in a nursing home resident with advanced dementia; severe pain in patient receiving chemo for metastatic cancer;  pneumonia in a child who has an incurable inborn error of metabolism; unresponsive patient with ROSC after CPR||0

A physician, including the emergency physician, must certify that the prognosis is 6 months or less is disease were to run it's  usual or predicted course. Palliative care, conversely, can be provided at any stage of illness.|||0
70|68|What does the palliative care team do?|0||Similar to hospice, the interdisciplinary palliative care consult team may consist of a physician, RN, social worker, a chaplain, and administrator; or it may include only an RN and physician. The American Board of Medical Subspecialties recognized palliative care in 2006. By 2007 there were >2,000 diplomate members, with board certification available to 10 subspecialties (Anesthesiology, EM, FM, IM, Pediatrics, PM and R, Psychiatry and Neurology, Radiology, Surgery, OB/Gyn. Not all physicians who practice palliative care are board certified, but are supported by their institutions as palliative care practitioners, and may be vying for board certification. Some palliative care programs allow advanced practice RNs with palliative care training to assist in consults. Other programs have a master's level, board-certified palliative care nurse practitioner may practice in parallel with physicians and who can diagnose/manage common physical, spiritual, psychological, and social needs of patients in need of palliative care.  Effective palliative care teams use all members of the interdisciplinary team to respond to consults. assessments and recommendations of social workers, chaplains, administrators who work within palliative care can be far more important contributors to wellness than RNs/physicians: an intervention by these team members in the ED can be a crucial point for patients and families struggling with end-of-life issues. Some services combine pain and palliative care services; others have an independent pain service addressing both pain management and other distressing symptoms. Palliative care services are justified by added service and/or cost avoidance, even though they don't generate significant fee-for-service revenue. they are sometimes supported by partnerships w/ community- or hospital-based hospices.||0
71|68|Early Consults Matter!|0||25% of U.S. hospitals have a palliative care service, some of which are available for ED consults, yet not used by EPs. Preliminary data show we can identify a large number of patients with palliative care needs on arrival to the ED. Some of these are available for consultations in the ED, yet many ED personnel do not use these services. Preliminary data indicate that a large number of patients with palliative care needs can be identified on arrival in the ED. calling a palliative care consult in the ED reduces ICU time (significantly reducing cost), but also improves quality of care, allows for the provision of excellent symptom management. patient's who had palliative care consults had reduced length of hospital stay, changed bed assignments which improved quality of care, improved symptom control score, increased patient satisfaction scores!||0
72|68|What are some barriers to consulting palliative care from the ED?|0||Although there are many palliative care programs in the U.S., many are small and face staffing difficulties. Many weren't designed to service ED needs/consults, a place that often requires 24-hour access to referrals and consults. EDs haven't been widely incorporated into the palliative care model's thrust to decrease length of stay for seriously ill hospitalized patients, but it has been recognized that early consults from the ED can be extraordinarily effective, and that need naturally exists for education, research, and policy partnerships between palliative care and EM.||0

   1. The durable power of attorney 
      1. Depending on statement in document and state law, a durable POA for health care can become effective even when pt competent. theoretically possible for proxy to act independently. A competent person will rarely intentionally sign over all health care decision making while still capable, so if such a form exists, the physician should check to be sure that this is what the patient intended.
   2. Springing power of attorney 
      1. Takes places only when a specific event occurs-eg, the event of a disability. becomes effective only after a physician has formally determined that a disability has occurred. This could mean a short delay and additional expense. It also has the potential to create uncertainty or disagreement among physicians and/or family over the degree of disability.
2. Health care proxies may not know the person's wishes. 
   1. Often times, the person named by the patient as the health care proxy may not actually know the patient's wishes. Additionally, the physician should also discuss with the patient how many proxies he or she wishes to have. It is generally preferable to have one proxy, but if co-proxies are desired, one proxy should be given authority over others in case of disagreement. Alternatively, an odd number of proxies is desirable because if an even number of proxies is selected this could create an impasse in the decision-making process. Proxy forms provide an opportunity to explore patient preferences in the ED. If a proxy has been named and the patient still has decision-making capacity, the ED team may stimulate a discussion between the proxy and the patient about goals of care and forms of documentation. Because proxy forms and instructional directives both have advantages and disadvantages, it is usually best to use both forms. In keeping with this, many forms have spaces for both proxy designation and instructional directives.

Parent: What is a framework for rapid Advanced Care Planning in the ED (72)"||0
87|85|What are benefits and limitations of using advanced directives in the ED?|0||Work w/ team to rapidly complete written or verbal directive to guide evolving situations in the ED.If done properly, it can stand as a foundation for planning (basis for the patient's subsequent care plan), whether patient hospitalized or referred to another health care setting. Advance care planning specific to the ED is rarely so simple as implementing existing advance care plans. the ultimate goal of advance care planning is to implement wishes in life-threatening situation. implementation is not always simple, and is not always achieved. Rapid planning may affect care during ED visit and follow up care. Patient/family may become aware of severity of illness during ED visit. ED experience may spark discussion||0
88|87|What forms of advanced planning documents orders can I use in my system?|0|"   1. Some state statutes limit implementation of instructional directives
   2. You may help to append state statutory form w/ more pt-centered form or letter
   3. State statutory forms strive to ensure compliance w/ law so physician protected against legal action if life-sustaining treatments withheld
   4. The state statutory form only secondarily includes pt preferences, so forms usually don't guide physician
   5. Statutory forms are most useful when appended to a more usable personal statement
   6. You can obtain info re: patient's wishes and implement them under protection of the statutory form when used togetherValidated forms should have been evaluated for:
   7. Always check face validity of a directive (what it seems to mean)
   8. Look for criterion-related validity (individual items prompt responses that make sense in relation to other items)
   9. Look for reliability (people make the same decision on two separate occasions)
   10. Look for usability in the clinical setting
   11. You may encounter other types of documents to understand and honor in your setting"|||0

      5. Patients' views, health status/age change over time
         Family may be in conflict, cultures view directives differently, issues of vulnerability
      6. May require interpretation of intent. 
         Frequently patient is unstable or may become unstable. 
      7. May require prognostication''in the event of a terminal illness''
      8. Directives may exist but patient and family do not have on hand
      9. Physician fears of litigation/criticism
      10. Physician is uncomfortable with interpretation of a document
      11. Research indicates ED nurses are not very knowledgeable re: advance directives in general and less so re: Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) and their state laws

      13. Although the completion of a comprehensive advance directive in the ED may not be a realistic begin the discussion!
      14. Patients who do have advance directives will typically not have access to them in an emergency (or verbal reports w/o document)

         1. 40% never thought about it
         2. 24% preferred that family members make the decision
         3. 23% were putting it off"|"CPR is virtually the only procedure that does not always require informed consent because it is a procedure that is done to save life under emergency circumstances. However, CPR is not always appropriate. Avoidance of CPR is important for terminally ill who seek peaceful natural death. recognize your role to identify goals of care 1st, then determine how to best achieve them. Many physicians find CPR or DNR discussions difficult, partly since successful approaches aren't included in training.  attending often conduct alone, behind closed doors. or assigns to med student or rez . discuss as part of ED adv care planning, Est GOC 1st, then make recs.
   1. CPR is the only procedure doesn't require informed consent
   2. CPR is often not medically appropriate
   3. Prolonged CPR is unlikely to be successful 
      Despite best efforts,  overall survival rate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest can be very low, depending on length + type of field resuscitation. Survival better in-hospital, esp if   witnessed TV suggests survival ~ 80%. really, highly variable, depends on underlying condition. w/ chronic, progressive terminal illness (end stage cancer, CHF, pulm dz , neurological dz) = extremely poor discharge survival rates, function. Prolonged resusc efforts for adults and children unlikely successful. d/c if no ROSC at any time w/in 30 min ACLS
   4. Discuss usual outcomes + goals of care
   5. ''Allowing natural death'' 
      ""Allow natural death'' = Do not attempt to restart heart/support ventilation in event of physiologic death, but may initiate many other measures for comfort (O2, fluids, nutrition, pain control). you care for pts at high risk for cardiac arrest + those arrest is imminent. you should determine whether attempt to reverse death in event of arrest is appropriate 4 pt. Ethically, you should advise re: usual outcome CPR. Patient autonomy, nonmalfeasance (do not harm), beneficence (do good), and justice (be fair) are widely used guiding principles of medical ethics. present best available info so can consider options -> autonomous decision
   6. Slow codes are unacceptable: 
      So-called slow codes or chemical-only codes are unacceptable approaches to the issue of whether to offer emergency attempts to restore airway, breathing, and circulation. The use of such codes promotes cynical approaches to decision making and insincere interactions between physicians and patients.
   7. Don't ever use: ''doing everything''
      It is coined '' abandonment language''. It forces an emotional subtext for someone who is loved. It is a given, that everyone- patient, family, physician, health care team-wants ""to do everything"" to achieve health and wellbeing of patient. discuss DNR w/in context of the host of other life-prolonging therapies, including elective intubation, MV, HD, surgery, Abx, artificial fluids. describe various scenarios and elicit patient's preferences rather than getting the DNR and leaving the patient.
   8. In advanced progressive illness (limited prognosis), identify goals to consider, will CPR achieve goals? 
      This approach deemphasizes CPR and DNR status discussions to parts of the greater discussion. in the real world patients will continue to need focused discussions on CPR, DNR
   9. Never address DNR status in isolation
   10. Use understandable language, use ''death''
   11. Clarify CPR is a Rx that tries to stop death from occurring
   12. If pt and family want more info, provide specific descriptions of what CPR involves
   13. Avoid implying the impossible is possible: 
      Conventional language: CPR =  ''re-starting the heart'' or ''putting on a breathing machine'' implies false sense condition is usually reversible and those heart and lung functions are isolated problems. w/ advanced illness, circ and breathing stop because relentless progression of  dz. If there were something that could be reversed, the medical team would do so long before pt stopped breathing. In discussing DNR w/ pt w/ life-threatening illness, avoid introducing CPR as ''shocking the heart if it stops'' or ''using a breathing machine if the lungs stop.''  reductionist approach fails to acknowledge  context-CPR is being used on a patient who is imminently dying
   14. Confirm understanding with the patient/surrogate and ED team 
      Before ending discussion, affirm what team will do 4 pt + confirm planned interventions. Full med interventions to reverse dz,sustain life are appropriate for many, including those w/ DNR. reiterate that if pt dies in spite of all efforts, we won't resusc. communicate your discussions w/ ED and subsequent care teams
   15. Ensure informed consent: 
      Ensure pt understands nature of directive + expected consequences, + any alternatives that exist. ensure they know that, in an emergency,  default = life-sustaining rx.  may not be ready to make such decisions in ED, may also feel badly if aggressive measures are undertaken leading to poor outcome. inform re: possible consequences of failure to decide. adv care planning discussions aren't =immediate decision making. they are effort to understand wishes. Adv directives = decisions, although some directives are too vague to be specific decisions re: interventions. translate goals statements n2 specific interventions. Similarly, advance planning documents may be specific or general. advance planning documents meet standards of informed consent, but are different from those necessary for decisions translated n2 MD orders.
   16. Challenges: 
      Even after adv care planning, research suggests EP\'s may not follow a legal directive. Of the 1,252 EP respondents 78% said they would honor legal advance directives regarding resuscitation, 7% said they would comply with unofficial documents, 6% said they would comply with verbal reports of advance directives, 62% reported that their decisions about resuscitation were based on fear of litigation or criticism, 55% said they have recently attempted numerous resuscitations despite expectations that such efforts would be futile, 78% indicated that, ideally, legal concerns should not influence a physician's decision about the practice of resuscitation, but most (94%) also felt that, in the current environment, legal concerns do influence practice. These findings underscore how advance care planning can fail to have its intended effect because emergency physicians do not know how to interpret and institute advance directives."||0

"|"You can use scenarios w/ patients: in most scenarios of declining prognosis, increasing disability, most have threshold to switch from curative, even burdensome, intervention to comfort. strive to discern what this threshold is for a certain patient. prepare team that patients/surrogates may feel they are ""settling for less"" by choosing comfort care pathways for a loved one, so you can be sensitive and supportive. cross-check w/ pt to verify that (s)he is comfortable with chosen goals. The threshold for moving from wanting to not wanting life-sustaining intervention will be clear for most patients when this approach is used. Some patients will have crossed the threshold already for their current health; others will cease to desire life-sustaining intervention in Scenario B, others in Scenario C. More detailed scenario-based advance care planning can be accomplished with worksheets such as those provided in the appendix to this module. For rapid, advance care planning in the ED, however, this short process can provide critical information.

96|95|Illness is a threat to the family system and can amplify existing problems|0||Few families function perfectly, but they are often the primary social unit that meets many human needs. It almost follows, that families have problems. Illness/changes in health may change individual roles, or may threaten the system and amplify existing problems. E.g., if the patient can no longer relate meaningfully to others, other members may take on new roles. Or if the family's primary provider is a trauma victim in your ED, other members may be too disoriented to make decisions or provide care as they are unfamiliar with this role. Death also impacts system and individual family members.||0
97|95|Events leading to ED visit are challenging, upsetting, emotional, anxiety-provoking|0||Events preceding and within an ED visit may generate strong emotions and differing assessments about right/wrong courses of action.  Patients/families commonly present with a degrees of existing conflict, and are commonly in conflict in the ED. ||0
98|95|May elicit varied assessments/expectations|0||Serious illness is of ultimate importance, and intense with death is imminent, but care interactions take place within a busy system among people who may have little or no prior relationship. we may have little time/energy, and take the path of least resistance in conflict by referring the back to the PCP/admitting team. this can be appropriate in cases when addressing conflict wouldn't be productive for the patient, family, or care system.

You may try a prompt to be more involved, but some need more support to overcome avoidant behavior. Some may not understand what is happening, or are in denial that death is imminent, and are coping by continuing as if there was no crisis. Then, some may respond to every change in the clinical situation as if it were a crisis to cope with the overwhelming, myriad of losses at the end of a life. you might overcome this by supporting these individuals more as they process many changes. ||0

There are families of origin, families of choice, families within families, and communities that function like families. How does the patient's family system function? Ask, ''What roles have [you] played in health care?'' ''How has everyone been changed by the illness?''  ''Are your roles strained?'' Is the family system in equilibrium or in danger of losing function? Illness demands a lot, and patients with limited social support systems will likely have unmet needs. Some vacant roles may be care providers, advocates, trusted companions, and surrogate decision makers. Find out if the surrogate decision maker knows his or her role?  Does (s)he know the patient's wishes for medical care in both the present and possible future scenarios?

104|101|Stage in the Patient\'s Life Cycle|0||Stage in the patient's life cycle Illness impacts people drastically, and the person's life-cycle stage affects this impact. Most people do not expect to encounter terminal illness before aging. most people feel that terminal illness is more appropriate to the latter stages of the life cycle. Life-cycle stage also affects physiological resilience and responses to illness and treatments. consider how the illness interacts with typical stressors of a given life-cycle stage.  how will illness/treatment demands impact the family at its current developmental stage. other strains and stressors associated with life-cycle stages include a new baby, job change, or recent loss. spirituality/faith the presence or absence of spiritual beliefs or a faith community affect how individuals/families cope. Beliefs and faith communities can bring spiritual, psychological, social, and practical support, or a source of distress at an already difficult time. know the patient's beliefs to help and assess whether suffering may be aided/undermined by the patient's spiritual life. Illness impacts spiritual well-being/trust in a beneficent being for a patient/family. some find faith becomes the all important comfort. humans tend to create a meaning/understanding of events, making it natural that illness impacts spiritual life. this can help us identify spiritual crises to refer to a counselor/chaplain to restore comfort in faith/access the faith community.||0

119|53|Issues/uses of Hospice in the ED|0||EP's can formulate next best steps of a care if we know the barriers to hospice, especially those in some nursing homes. We should know how to initiate a referral, and understand services hospice does and does not offer; not insignificantly, because it can become more difficult for patients and caregivers to accept or continue hospice if we give inaccurate information about the system, symptom management, or related decision making. Most patients will receive care at home while they are receiving hospice services and will never access the ED, but many ED presentations each year are either receiving or would benefit from hospice-type services. Initiating these services and seamlessly transitioning to hospice from the ED can provide relief of suffering and facilitate a higher quality of life. A challenge is that providers view hospice as appropriate only when a patient is obviously dying or very near death, resulting in one-third of the more than 1 million Americans referred for hospice dying in <7 days and over half dying in the first 30 days. There is an initiative for earlier referrals to hospice care to allow more to benefit from services for weeks and months, not days. The terminal phase of illness is difficult to predict, but lack of understanding about formulating an estimate partially explains why many Americans receive services only at the extreme end of life||0

121|119|Hospice Basics|0||In previous centuries, the primary goal of medicine was to provide comfort, but in the latter half of the 20th century there have been significant developments in science and technology waging an aggressive  fight against illness and death.  The primary goals shifted to curing illness and prolonging life. In this  process, we have at times paid less attention to symptoms, the relief of suffering, and care of the dying. In the 1960s and 1970s, hospice and palliative care movements sprang up in the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada to fill a void caring for the dying. Historically, the US Medicare hospice benefit covered hospice care of last 6 mo of life.  Programs tended to admit patients with incurable cancer. More recently, hospice and palliative care programs have been evolving into medical practices and programs that focus on relief of suffering and improvement in quality of life for those patients who have a broader range of prognoses.  a newer paradigm of palliative medicine, addresses the problem of the historical dichotomy of medical decision making for goals of care first focused on therapies with curative intent and only later shifting goals/decisions to relieve suffering only when those therapies are no longer effective. This common current situation has been defined partly by the Medicare hospice benefit, which requires that a patient's prognosis must be <6 months and that patient must agree to forego any therapy with a curative intent in order to avail themselves of this benefit. However, many patients, families, and professionals are not prepared to give up therapies aimed at cure and life-prolongation in order to focus totally on relief of suffering. Thus, an unintended consequence of the original legislation has been that many dying Americans are never referred to hospice programs. Moreover, studies show that patients with life-threatening illness experience multiple symptoms and ongoing needs for psychological, social, spiritual, and practical support. Relief of suffering should be pursued where suffering exists. Clinicians should not wait for the point at which all attempts for cure are exhausted, or the patient/caregivers plead to suddenly stop curative efforts and focus on the relief of suffering. With earlier access to palliative care,, patients and families may feel better, be able to continue in a more normal lifestyle, maintain more capacity to fight the illness and undergo treatment, and have a better capacity to accomplish personal goals in the later stages of life.  ''hospice'', from the Latin hospitium, meaning guesthouse. During the 1960s, Dr. Cicely Saunders established the modern hospice movement at St. Christopher\'s Hospice near London which initiated an organized team approach to professional palliative caregiving. The U.S. first hospice was in New Haven, Connecticut in 1974. In the U.S., hospice evolved primarily as a home care program. It currently cares for about 1/3 of all dying Americans, and is the most comprehensive system for the terminally ill in the U.S. Medicare pays for 85% of all hospice care in the United States. Insurers other than Medicare also cover hospice services. They base eligibility on (and provide services that mimic) the Medicare hospice benefit. Most hospice companies in the United States follow the federal guidelines set forth in the Medicare hospice benefit so that they can submit charges to Medicare. It's focus is comfort and the acceptance of death as natural. Although hospice provides service to anyone with terminal illness, ? of dying americans don't use it.. Some never accept they have limited life expectancy, some may see hospice as ''giving up'', and some providers feel uncomfortable with services or referrals. Only a fraction of eligible patients who die in the U.S. actually receive hospice care. In 2004, median length of stay for a Medicare beneficiary receiving hospice was 15 days. 75% of hospice patients died outside a hospice facility in a private residence, nursing home, or other residential facility. largest group of hospice patients had cancer (46%), but 54% with other diseases are increasingly cared for under hospice. in 2004: heart disease (12%), dementia (9.8%), debility (9.2%), and lung disease (7.3%). Over 90% of hospice patients were over the age of 65.||0

123|121|Hospice Care is Protocol Driven|0||Physician authorized protocols for symptoms and meds may focus on lack of need for IV administration, e.g. oral/rectal, subcutaneous (fluids/PCA), sublinqual/transdermal. Subcutaneous, transdermal, and rectal routes to defer painful intravenous access or intramuscular injections are often used in hospice but often atypical for the emergency physician. E.g. haldoperidol for vomiting or atropine 2% eye drops may be sublingual for secretions at the end of life.||0
124|121|What IS hospice?|0||It's a comprehensive care system attending to physical, psychological, spiritual aspects of care. uses an interdisciplinary team approach typically a physician, nurses, a social worker, a chaplain, a hospice administrator, and a hospice medical director.

126|121|What is the role of the emergency physician?|0||The emergency physician can support families and caregivers by reassuring them that the intent of the primary physician is to provide the best care to the patient. After a physician certifies patient is hospice-eligible, that physician may choose to defer attending responsibilities and transfer care to the medical director or a physician of the hospice facility. Although physicians may feel that they are acting in the best interest of the patient, this turnover in patient care can make the patient and family feel that they have been abandoned. ||0

Not covered under home health, covered by hospice during periods of medical crisis"|For home health pt must be homebound, normally unable to leave the home with visits outside home short and infrequent. home health doesn't cover supplies or meds. services may be stopped when needs change. medicare reimbursement varies by region. The Medicare hospice benefit (MHB) has come to define hospice services in the United States, even for patients who are not covered by Medicare. Most hospices accept federal funding and, therefore, have hospice programs that fulfill the service delivery guidelines of Medicare. Rarely, there are some independent, nonprofit hospices that do not accept federal funding and have a different service delivery model that may consist entirely of volunteers. For the emergency physician, familiarity with the MHB will provide an excellent overview of the scope of services provided. the levels of the medicare hospice benefit are: routine home care, general inpatient care, inpatient respite care, continuous home care. daily reimbursement rates must cover all meds/services provided. The patient is financially responsible for $5 or less for each prescription for pain or symptom control and/or 5% of the daily charge for respite care. However, these charges are almost never applied. Ability of hospice to provide expensive treatments is limited since reimbursement per a fixed daily rate. For example, a patient with DVT and cancer weighing 80 kg receives enoxaparin at 1mg/kg/day (80 mg). The cost of enoxaparin alone is $1,400 for a 30-day supply. For that same 30-days, the hospice would collect an average of $3,923 for routine home care which must cover all services, related medicines, and equipment costs. Only a hospice with a large average daily census could absorb the losses in covering a patient on expensive meds. we can consult with the hospice provider about availability of expensive therapies (including IV antibiotics and oral anti-tumor treatments) case-by-case.||0

129|121|MYTH 1: Hospice is a place|0||Although some hospice providers do have inpatient units, hospice is not just a place, but rather a system of care.  It's a set of services that are provided in the home, in freestanding inpatient facilities, in hospitals, or in nursing homes.Some hospice companies use wards or units within the hospital setting and others use beds dispersed throughout the hospital; some use both. homeless are usually covered and care is provided at LTC.||0
130|121|MYTH 2: A patient must be DNR to be hospice|0||Hospice cannot require DNR status to receive hospice If patient has elected resuscitation at end of life and is nearing need for resuscitation, a hospice provider may call to EMS for transfer. Being full code is not a barrier to hospice care. patients or surrogates who've accepted the hospice philosophy of comfort care have not concomitantly always chosen a DNR or DNR-CCO status, especially in the initial phase when patients and families are just accepting the natural disease process and it's terminality. Renegotiation of code status may occur as patient/family move through later phases of acceptance of dying.||0
131|121|MYTH 3: Hospice will change/remove all meds|0||Hospice will optimize meds for symptoms, and will often change to hospice formulary drugs. Hospices are not required to pay for any meds unrelated to terminal diagnosis. E.g., if primary certification is cancer, hospice won't pay for her antihypertensives. The patient's private insurance should continue to cover these other meds when patient enters hospice.||0
132|121|MYTH 4: You can\'t go to the hospital or see your doctor anymore|0||Hospice covers all care (including medicines, procedures, ED visits, inpatient stays) related to certifying diagnosis as part of the per diem they receive. The payor may be directly billed for any primary provider's fees enabling patients to see their PCP while hospice.||0
133|121|MYTH 5: Hospice will not provide artifical fluids or nutrition|0||Hospices give fluids and artificial nutrition for comfort if indicated, even if they do not necessarily add to and may detract from comfort at the end of life. fluids are often given subcutaneously, by ''hypodermoclysis'', a slow infusion via a 25g needle under the skin.||0
134|121|MYTH 6: Patients automatically rovke the hopsice benefit by going to the ED|0||The patient/surrogates have agreed to comfort care and that any services must have prior approval. If hospice authorizes transfer, it will usually cover all ED services, but if patient who unilaterally decides this without partnering with the hospice may be at risk of losing hospice services or be held responsible for the ED bill.||0
135|121|MYTH 7: Patients will not get treatment for acute conditions like infections|0||Just assess goals of care for every new therapy!  Antibiotics are often given to hospice patients. It may make sense to use antibiotics for comfort or maintenance of function. ||0
136|121|MYTH 8: There is no one on call at the hospice after hours|0||Someone's on call, 24 hr/day. As with any system, the nurse on call may be difficult to reach, especially compared to the familiarity of 911. Often times the hospice staff but not the family may expect a rapid clinical deterioration.  Moreover, a hospice nurse cannot get to the home as quickly as a rescue unit.||0
137|121|MYTH 9: All current therapies are discontinued|0||A hospice may cover one therapy and not another. Avoid giving any misinformation if you don't know; allow the hospice to inform re: what they will cover before the patient signs||0
138|121|MYTH 10: If the physician certifies prognosis of <6 months, and the patient lives longer, the physician gets in trouble with the insurer and/or government. |0||There is no penalty to any physician who has acted in good faith if the patient does not die in 6 months. The physician is certifying that it is his or her clinical opinion that, if the disease runs its usual course, the physician would not be surprised if the patient died within the 6-month time frame. For a condition with a prognosis of six months, in a population with that condition, half will live less and half will live more. In fact, patients often live longer in hospice, some for years. A physician certifies at each reassessment. If the patient lives longer than expected, they aren't necessarily removed from hospice; but, there are cases where reassessments indicate the disease isn't following its usual course, so this patient may be discharged from hospice. (S)he may re-enroll if condition deteriorates and recertification of <6month  prognosis is probable again.||0
139|119|Stepwise approach for the hospice patient presenting to the ED|0||Because the philosophy is to accept dying as normal, much effort goes into educating patients and families about how to use the hospice in emergencies. Late referrals to hospice, combined with the task of retraining patients and families to call hospice instead of 911, result in ED visits by hospice patients.||0
140|139|Discern Reason for presentation|0||||0
141|140|Is it a desire for a 2nd opinion or immediate physical exam or need to see a physician?|0||Or request for artificial nutrition/hydration or other treatments, or to revoke hospice and reinitiate aggressive care. guidelines dont require hospice pt be seen by a physician, but may vary by state. Some patients/caregivers take sufficient comfort from the care of an RN. Others need to speak directly w/ a doctor as a pivotal point to accept, particularly in the active phase of dying. It is now rare for PCP's to visit patients at home. Hospice physicians will do home visits, but this practice is not as well established. Sometimes the patient and family have a change of mind about hospice. There is no penalty if they want to re-enter standard medical care and opt out of the Medicare hospice benefit. It is useful to allow the hospice team to participate with the ED and the patient/family in discussing this option.||0
142|140|Is patient near death and family/caregivers acutly unable to accept or cope with it?|0||Regardless of preparation, caregivers/surrogates may be unable to accept signs/symptoms of imminent death and refuse/ignore hospice staff assistance in this stressful/emotionally taxing time. Although death is natural, some have an extraordinary number of symptoms at the end, and caregivers may be unable to administer symptom medications. ||0
143|140|Does patient have distressing symptoms?|0||Not relieved by medications given at home. Hospice care teams take pride in their ability to manage symptom by using templates and protocols, but a symptom can develop that neither the patient nor the family caregiver can handle. There can be delay in delivery of new medications or supplies for a new urgent symptom such as pain or shortness of breath.||0
144|140|Has patient lost a support device?|0||e.g Feeding tube or airway. Hospice practitioners may lack experience necessary to replace devices. Most common ED presentations for palliative care patients are lost gastrostomy tubes and tracheal airways which can cause panic in patients and families. The lay or professional home care provider not uncommonly dislodges device in moving the patient. Before replacing the device in the ED, determine if patient/surrogate thinks it's still necessary: don't assume the wish is to continue the device just because they came to the ED. They may want an opportunity to discuss its effectiveness. you can/should give permission to discontinue its use if it isnt meeting the patient\'s goals. the percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) is the most available and most commonly used enteral feeding devices in palliative care patients. head and neck cancer patients may have pharyngostomy or esophagostomy tubes, or gastroenterostomy, duodenostomy,  jejunostomy tubes for complicated resections. You cannot tell what kind of enteral tube it is solely by physical examination. A skin incision near an ostomy site suggests that the tube can't be easily removed. a tube for a well-established and granulated tract may be done nonoperatively.  Gastrostomy tubes usually include rubber, silicone, and polyurethane, and a flange or crossbar (bumper) to anchor in the stomach/prevent migration into small bowel. a foley can be used to replace temporarily, but is difficult to secure to skin, the latex balloon weakens in stomach acid. but it may be used permanently if life expectancy is limited. Tracheostomies commonly dislodge, occlude, and can fracture. patients/famililies may be frightened by the presentation of acute respiratory distress. consider this patient  to have a partially or fully obstructed device. Plugging is usually secondary to dried respiratory secretions, blood, or aspirated materials. Secretions may act as a ball valve allowing air in not out. Granuloma formation just distal to the tube may also obstruct. Emergency management includes attempts to clear the trachea (by a consultant/specialist if new/bleeding, high-flow oxygen, and immediate exchange of the tracheostomy. with intermittent ventilation or when head is flexed, the tip can shift and obstruct. try gently extending the head, or pulling slightly tracheostomy slightly back. >20% of tracheotomy complications presenting to the ED have bleeding. 10% of all tracheostomy hemorrhages and for most tracheostomy-related deaths are secondary to the cuff/tip eroding a major vessel. Minor bleeding is often postop or secondary to a granuloma. Assume patient has life-threatening hemorrhage if there is brisk bleeding from the tracheostomy, hemoptysis, or a history of either. Many have a sentinel bleed hours/days before a catastrophic one. Some report only a new cough or retrosternal pain. Presume any blood >10mL to be arterial. attempt tamponade with a digit in the airway, knowing it can cause significant discomfort to the patient. discuss palliative options and goals of care before initiating more invasive therapy||0

She is washing dishes and cuts her hand on a knife. Is this service covered by the hospice? No. The hospice provider is responsible only for those services related to the primary certifying diagnosis. In this case, her laceration is unrelated to her cancer and thus Medicare Part A and B or her regular insurer would pay for charges related to the laceration.

Example 2. Mrs. Jones is receiving hospice services for terminal breast cancer with metastasis to her femur. She falls, sustains a femur fracture, and presents to the ED. Is this service covered by the hospice? Yes. The fracture is clearly related to the cancer. The hospice is responsible for using the per diem rate to pay for services for Mrs. Jones' care. In the case of this ED visit, the hospice would pay the hospital for services rendered to Mrs. Jones in the ED and the hospice would get no additional money from the regular insurer.

Example 3. Mrs. Jones is receiving hospice services for terminal breast cancer with metastasis to her femur and she also has diabetes. She presents to the ED with uncontrolled diabetes. You would like to discharge her on diabetic medications. Does hospice cover the cost of her diabetes medications? No. The only medicines covered by hospice are the ones related to the primary certifying diagnosis. In this case, terminal breast cancer is not the primary cause of the diabetes, the diabetes is deemed to be unrelated, and the medicines are not covered by the hospice.

Example 4. Mrs. Jones is receiving hospice services for terminal breast cancer with metastasis to her femur and she also has diabetes. She presents to the ED with uncontrolled pain. Does the hospice cover the ED visit? Possibly. The hospice must approve any ED visits. Pain control is routinely provided by the hospice. The hospice will often review a case such as this and determine whether the patient or the hospice will have to pay for the ED visit."|||0

Overcome discomfort about discussing death. 
      1. Physicians may sense deep discomfort with death and grief and failure in ''the inability to cure a patient.'' Many perceive the initiation of hospice as something to be done when everything else has failed. we may fear initiating the discussion about hospice will destroy hope for patients and families. 
   2. Focus on symptoms and relief of distress rather than disease reversal
   3. Overcome barrier of declaring prognosis. 
      1. There is no penalty for a good faith estimate that prognosis is <6mo. No penalty is attached to the physician if a patient outlives the clinical estimate. services can start with the physician's order certifying the prognosis.  this requires we prognosticate, even though most of us are reluctant to do so. All hospice medical directors can certify prognosis, even when the private physician is unwilling. 
   4. Overcome barrier of shifting care options 
      1. Stopping or limiting therapies is a challenging step, especially if hospice limits coverage for expensive care or care which doesn't manage symptoms. hospitalization is the familiar pattern of care for most patients and families in exacerbations or declines and hospice care may find it difficult to adjust, particularly in the beginning. They may, for example, have to learn to call the hospice nurse when they need assistance instead of dialing 911. Stopping cancer-directed therapy or radiation can be an extraordinary challenge. Some cancer patients often want palliative chemo/radiation that may be beneficial even in late-stages. Newer expensive chemotherapies have remarkably low side effect profiles. If primary certification is cancer, all therapies approved (including chemo, radiation, support meds like blood cell stimulators) are covered. But not all hospices can cover even these palliative treatments. The hospice who struggles to provide expensive services, may risk fiscal insolvency and of no help to all their patients. Likewise, even if dialysis is related to the primary certifying diagnosis, many hospices are reluctant to enroll HD patients.

163|162|Long term care setting|0|EPs care for many nursing home patients at end of life, so: ''Why can't they take care of this at the nursing home?''|Although nearly ? of all older adults die in the nursing home, the majority die without comprehensive palliative care (or hospice) benefits. The Institute of Medicine has reported/identified many problems in long-term care. The challenges of this setting are monumental: staffing shortages, admission of increasingly sicker patients to staff lacking the training to care for such patients. Nursing home staff can become close patients-and panic just as families do. a nursing home transfers patients in last days or months of illness for many reasons which may not include reversing or treating the underlying illness.  they are usually unexpected circulatory, respiratory, CNS compromise; fracture; injury; infection, and are influenced by severity of the underlying problem, availability of nursing home services, and family request for transfer.||0
164|162|Low rates of hospice use by nursing home patients|0||Hospice use in U.S. nursing homes went from 11% in 1992 to 35% in 2000. despite an estimated 75% of U.S. nursing homes having some form of partnership with a hospice with contracts to meet regulatory guidelines for each party, the nursing home may not regularly use hospice services. The responsibility to oversee hospice services is left to the patient's attending physician, therefore nursing homes may not have procedures to ensure patients receive the services. There are many hurdles to good end-of-life care in the long-term care setting. Quality indicators for the terminally ill suggest at a minimum, nursing homes provide pain and dyspnea management, and advance care planning. A project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Best Practices for Nursing Home End-of-Life Care (Executive Summary 2007), looked for collaborative solutions and found that patients at EOL enrolled in hospice have a higher quality of care, lower rates of hospitalization; and that nursing homes w/ a hospice presence positively affect non-hospice residents. The report concluded that successful collaborations of long term facilities enact consistency and communication and a customer service approach. features of these partnerships included a norm of mutual respect; routine knowledge sharing between providers; policies and procedures that clarified each collaborating party's role, and a hospice presence.||0
165|162|Nursing|0||The Centers for Medicaid Services recommends a minimum of 2 hours/day of aid by a certified nurses' aid, 45 minutes by a licensed practical nurse, 12 minutes by an RN. In 2004, a review of data over 8-years revealed 90% of nursing homes weren't providing this minimum standard.||0
166|162|Lack of EOL education|0||Ironically, nursing home education does not routinely include palliative and hospice care for their nurses, who interact with patients most and who may be most capable to recognize someone's end-of-life needs. Good end of life care depends on the nursing staff negotiating and supporting goals of care||0
167|162|Physician Involvement|0||Under federal guidelines, an attending physician must visit the nursing home patient, but the time period varies. PCPs should visit each resident at least once every 30 days for the first 90 days after admission, and at least once every 60 days afterwards, but they may delegate every other scheduled visit to an NP or PA if within their scope of practice and state regulations. The typical physician who cares for a nursing home patient spends < 2 hours per week in the nursing home. Medicare requires newly admitted patients be asked about wishes for advance directives; not that the physician, patient, or surrogates discuss resuscitation status, which typically does not occur.||0
168|162|The EP\'s role|0||If we begin discussing the option of hospice referral in the ED, we may improve end-of-life care in the nursing home. EDs can develop mechanisms with long-term care agencies to improve hospice and palliative care options for patients.||0
169|1|How Do I Manage Common Symptoms?|0||||0
170|169|Common Symptoms|0||Pain management is appropriately emphasized in advanced illnesses; however, most suffer from non-pain symptoms which can be even more distressing to patients and families. Unrelieved symptoms may preclude goals of relieving psychological, social, spiritual suffering, improving quality of life, and achieving closure. it goes against our Emergency Medicine training at times and makes us sometimes uneasy to focus on symptoms, which we see as clues to diagnosis which will improve as we address the disease. But when we act without full understanding of the pathophysiology, pharmacology, interventions AND the potential risks, interactions, or adverse effects of appropriate medications, we undertreat symptoms. E.g. wide prevalence of hypoalgesia in malignant pain patients presenting to the ED. Moreover, symptom relief may be all that is required when the goals of care preclude disease management. You might not need to wait for more work up, if symptoms are debilitating or patient is too weak to undergo interventions/investigations. use continuous or around-the-clock medication administration for continuous  symptoms with breakthrough doses PRN (e.g. malignant pain). Key is in educating/involving patient and family caregivers. you may encourage a diary after they leave the ED to facilitate future OP or IP management. if management is complex (e.g.  if symptoms are interrelated and multiple occur together), consult palliative care and members of the interdisciplinary team to optimize therapy and minimize adverse drug events and interactions||0
171|170|Dyspnea (air hunger)|0||Sense of drowning or being smothered, can be one of the most frightening symptoms for patients/caregivers.

185|183|Oxygen|0||Research has shown that a majority those reporting breathlessness do not have correlative measures of hypoxemia (eg, pulse oximetry, blood gas determination). So remember when your goal is to treat this symptom and assess the patient's relief after interventions, turn your focus to the patient at the bedside instead of looking solely at pulse oximetry or blood gases, which may for that case actually be uncomfortable/expensive. Does a therapeutic trial of oxygen achieve the goal to make the patient feel better? if so, use supplemental oxygen.  just remember, oxygen may have a placebo effect in nonhypoxemic patients, and it is a potent symbol of medical care. portable oxygen is expensive, not reimbursed by all payers. Does cool air moving across the patient's face (eg, from compressed air or a fan) achieve that same goal? some hypothesize air movement stimulates the V2 branch of the fifth cranial nerve, centrally inhibiting the sense of breathlessness.||0

   8. Chlorpromazine and promethazine have both been reported to improve breathlessness, and synergistic with opioids"|"Research has shown opioids can relieve breathlessness in patients without deranged respiratory rate or ABGs, but the precise mechanism is unclear, but thought to include central and peripheral effects. Sub-analgesic doses may work in the opioid-nai?ve. To simplify dosing, establish the effective dose, and convert it to an extended-release preparation. Using opiates should equate to preparing to concomitantly manage their adverse effects (e.g. the ubiquitous, inevitable constipation). nebulized opioids anecdotally reported to be effective, but in phase II studies and placebo-controlled studies, they weren't superior to nebulized saline.
Pharmacologic tolerance and any fear of addiction is clinically insignificant in managing breathlessness in advanced illness. Relieving the symptom of dyspnea may actually increase exercise tolerance and mobility. It has been shown that when dosing guidelines for dyspnea are followed, respiratory depression doesn't occur.The principle of double effect is commonly cited in cases where physician treats with intent/expectation of a good outcome (eg, relieve a symptom), while knowing there's a chance for an undesired, secondary effect (e.g. death). Many feel this action is ethical after informed consent is obtained.  all treatments have both intended effects and unintended, potentially adverse, consequences. Many believe opioids/anxiolytics have unusually or unacceptably high risk of adverse event that could end a life, particularly in the frail near that end of life if used improperly or, in rare cases, when used properly. we should understand then discuss all potential benefits/risks with patients with cognizance of goals for care. In symptom control, however, this principle rarely applies. The secondary adverse consequence of death is not likely to occur. Clouding this ethical construct/intuition is the notion that suffering states might make death an appealing choice. We know treatments carry a risk of adverse events, e.g. death, for many interventions and noninterventions; e.g. chemotherapy, surgery, TPN for short gut syndrome, or stopping all tests or avoiding surgery respectively. currently, most deem an action ethical if: (a) the intent is to relieve suffering and not hasten death, (b) death is a possible but not inevitable outcome of the interventions, and (c) there is fully informed consent. if action is intended to cause death as a means end suffering/control symptoms, less agree on its morality. physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are quite different both clinically and ethically. But, an opioid can be safely used for breathlessness with very minimal risk of death, if accepted dosing guidelines are followed. So many providers grossly over estimate and don't understood the risk of respiratory depression. Drowsiness, confusion, depressed consciousness occur long before respiratory rate is compromised particularly in someone in acute pain, hence the effectiveness of PCA's and regimens based on sound pharmacology."||0

188|170|Nausea/Vomiting|0||These are common in many advanced diseases. Nausea is an unpleasant subjective sensation secondary to stimulation of GI lining, the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the base of the fourth ventricle, the vestibular apparatus, or the cerebral cortex. the vomiting center directs the neuromuscular reflex of a final common pathway, i.e.  vomiting, after stimulation of one or more of these areas. Stimulation is by the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, and histamine which are all within the chemoreceptor trigger zone. they are all also present (with serotonin playing a large role) in the lining of the GI tract. Acetylcholine and histamine are predominant players in vestibular apparatus. The  awareness of nausea, inability to keep food or fluids down, the associated acid and bitter tastes, and unpleasant smells of vomitus may be distressing. cortex stimulation and responses are complex, not associated with specific neurotransmitters, and seem to be learned (eg, the anticipatory nausea associated with chemotherapy or nausea related to anxiety).||0
189|188|Etiologic categories and targeted treatment|0||Multiple causes for nausea and vomiting, but symptom relief is usually achieved if we choose the right meds and understand them.  choosing the right drug depends on targeting the etiologies, but it's frequently not possible to identify or specifically correct the underlying etiology. Therapeutic trials may suggest the etiology. When causes are known, the burden of the disease-modifying intervention may outweigh the potential benefit. Empiric antiemetics usually starts with one med that targets the presumed mechanism. optimize that dose dose before adding a second med/different mechanism of action.

Sadly, this rare, even with parenteral/enteral nutrition. anorexia/cachexia are typically irreversible and represent disease progression. Loss of appetite, weight, and energy are not strictly the result of malnutrition, and providing nutrition, even parenterally, does not change the disease course. Helping patients/families navigate these distinctions can diminish guilt, hostility, or conflict; and redirect focus to things that may improve quality of life. This said, it may be worthwhile to assess dysphagia, odynophagia, meds, or infections that might be causing or exacerbating the problem. the current therapies that can improve appetite and add weight, haven't proven to affect longevity.

And, community and patient financial resources may be limited. you may have noticed patients waiting for specialized pain with complaints of the inability to get an appointment, the need to have their medical records (including work ups and radiographs) available for review, the need to have a referral from a primary care physician, and the need for an accepted insurance plan.

227|225|Terminology|0|"   1. Chronic Pain--traditionally defined as pain >6mo.
      1. Sustained by a complex neurological process. Pathology may be unknown. may be recurrent: chronic, persists with pain-free intervals. may be due to demonstrable pathophysiological causes or there may be no demonstrable pathology that causes the pain. Chronic pain syndromes are thought to be sustained by a more complex process governed by AMPA, (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylsexazole-4-proprionic acid), the glutamate-mediated NMDA receptor, nitrous oxide (NO), and substance P. Central sensitization is the normal response to a persistent noxious stimuli. Chronic stimulation of the NMDA receptor results in substance P release which stimulates nerve regrowth in the spinal cord and remodeling to produce changes consistent with those found in neuropathic pain, including sensory alterations such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Central sensitization and activation of the NMDA receptors is thought to decrease responsiveness to endorphins and exogenous opioids. It is thought that the new neuronal connections that are formed in chronic pain lack mu-receptors and this has an important implication in opioid responsiveness. Notably however, drugs that antagonize the NMDA receptor (eg, ketamine and methadone) may be more helpful.
   2. Acute Pain-the normal, predicted physiological response to a noxious chemical, thermal or mechanical stimulus, generally time-limited and typically associated with invasive procedures, trauma and disease.
      1. traditionally defined as <30 days, subacute 1-6 months. In acute pain nocioceptors are stimulated and transmit nerve impulses to the spinal cord then higher centers. it's associated with an autonomic response. Epinephrine and norepinephrine acutely induce tachycardia, small vessel vasoconstriction, diaphoresis, and a sense of dread. It is thought to be adaptive for the individual to stop or avoid the offending agent. Current models suggest additional maladaptive features, e.g. altered immune response.
   3. Malignant Pain--
   4. Oligoanalgesia--
   5. Chemical Coping--
   6. Addiction-the persistent compulsive use of drugs
      1. which is a primary, chronic, neurobiologic process influenced by genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors. Characteristic behaviors include: impaired control over drug use, craving, compulsive and continued use despite harm. Physical dependence and tolerance are normal physiological consequences of extended opioid therapy for pain and are not the same as addiction.
   7. Chronic Pain-a state in which pain persists beyond a usual course of acute disease or healing of an injury.
      1. It may or may not be associated with an acute or chronic pathologic process causing continuous or intermittent pain over months or years. Chronic pain is not acute pain, and it is not necessarily nonmalignant. if chronic pain is not malignant, if not malignant, chronic pain is experienced within context of disease experience in serious or life-threatening illness. like in all palliative care, attend to physical, psychological, social, spiritual issues w/ (non)pharmacological approach
   8. Pain-An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.
   9. Physical Dependence-a state of adaptation manifested by drug class-specific signs/symptoms which can be reproduced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, decreasing serum levels of the drug, and/or administration of an antagonist.
      1. Physical dependence, by itself, is not pathognomonic/diagnostic of addiction. non-opioid meds exhibiting physical dependence include corticosteroids, beta-blockers, and alpha-adrenergic agents.
   10. Pseudoaddiction-An iatrogenic syndrome, in which providers misinterpret relief-seeking behaviors for drug-seeking (commonly seen with addiction). 
   11. Substance Abuse-use of any substance(s) for non-therapeutic or purposes other than those for which it is prescribed (e.g. recreational or psychological).
   12. Tolerance-a physiologic state in which regular use of a drug results in the need to increase the dose to achieve a specific effect, or using a constant dose over time reduces an effect.
      1. Tolerance may or may not be evident during opioid treatment and does not equate with addiction."|Pain categories may overlap||0

1. Manage psychological comorbidities in tandem
   1. the role of psychological factors in deterring treatment of chronic pain has been well recognized. It is critical to treat these in tandem to physical symptoms for results.
   2. Clarify-[you] would never accuse this is ''all in the head''
      1. Some patients and clinicians may interpret a question about psychological symptoms as an accusation. using a genuinely respectful disposition that acknowledges the power and reality of psychological suffering should go a long way to assure the patient (s)he is not being disparaged 
   3. Chemical coping
      1. consider a patient's psychological/social support structure if you detect/suspect chemical coping, medication abuse or misuse. Some use chemicals to cope with stress which may constitute a misuse syndrome but not necessarily addiction or abuse.

Methadone is a racemic mix of levo and dextro isomers: the levo form binds at opioid receptors and both forms can block the NMDA receptor. But, the equianalgesic dose of methadone varies greatly, and depends on how much oral morphine equivalent a patient takes. It is hypothesized that by being both an opioid receptor agonist and an NMDA-receptor antagonist, methadone is much more potent than expected. So some find methadone to be an effective second-line opioid for neuropathic pain; but some find it too fickle.||0

But, the efficacy of short-acting forms is limited and intermittent high blood opioid levels create problems. consult the PCP before starting/escalating either short- or long-acting.||0
255|253|Okay to prescribe but be sure to consider a long-term view|0||There are a myriad of medications prescribed for chronic pain, but we are most often faced with the challenge of whether to refill or initiate opioids. Opioids may or may not be helpful in the case of chronic pain because of the complexity of the disease. In the case of opioid-responsive chronic pain, it is medically and ethically appropriate to treat with an opioid. There is literature that suggests that the use of opioids in chronic pain may be more harmful than helpful when used inappropriately and that chronic opioids in nonmalignant pain should be properly assessed for effectiveness, closely monitored, and titrated by a single provider or practice. There is great consensus that the therapy should be closely monitored for effectiveness with an interdisciplinary approach to physical, psychological, and social factors. It is imperative that the clinician understand that a patient with chronic pain or an acute exacerbation is unlikely to benefit from treatment unless there is a comprehensive pain care model and that what appear to be sympathetic efforts in the ED to manage chronic pain may not be the right plan. The American Academy of Pain Medicine and the American Pain Society believe that the principles of good medical practice should guide safe opioid prescribing in chronic pain. Based on the history, physical, and comprehensive ED pain assessment, it may be entirely appropriate to initiate or refill opioids for an ED patient with chronic nonmalignant pain. When initiating or refilling opioids, however, it is important to ensure that a global care plan is in place. Patients or their surrogate(s) should be informed of the risks, benefits, and conditions of opioid prescribing, and told that periodic review is necessary to assess global functioning. They should also be made aware that opioids may not be helpful as a pain management strategy. Far too often, patients leave the ED with an opioid prescription but with poor documentation and this can potentially keep difficult pain cases from being followed and referred appropriately.||0
256|253|Inform patient or surrogate of risks and benefits and that follow-up is critical|0||The clinician must make a hard choice as to how pain will be managed in the ED for patients who do not have follow-up plan. After the appropriate history and physical exam, it may be necessary to inform patients that it is difficult (if not impossible) to initiate an appropriate care plan that would involve medication management if the patient does not have a primary care physician, fails to follow up, or makes no attempt to comply with the pain care plan.||0

If appropriate, establish and inform patient of any limitations to future treatments in the ED and guidance and requirements for follow up with the primary provider and document this in the medical record. The specialty of pain medicine is quite developed and more and more centers have dedicated pain services available or, in other cases, a palliative care service may fill this role. The treatment of patients with chronic pain, with or without an acute exacerbation, is complicated. Emergency clinicians should freely consult specialty services, when possible, in order to assist in the care of the patient and to evolve their own pain practice. Issues regarding who may or may not be appropriate for admission for pain control can be clarified by consultation of the specialist. Those in chronic pain and exacerbated may come to be ED expecting a quick fix, a different answer, or a new therapy. emphasized in a supportive way that meaningful gains in chronic pain control can take time. Emphasis should be placed on improving the patient's functional capacity. PTS should be encouraged and made to understand that continuity of care is one of the most important aspects of care. The goal of pain treatment in chronic nonmalignant pain is to attain and maintain the highest level of function with the lowest side effects profile. The absolute pain score becomes less important in chronic pain than acute pain. The provider should not expect pain scores to improve with therapy over the course of hours, days, or even weeks. The Model Policy for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain pertains to all physicians who prescribe opioids for pain, but the Model Policy also serves as an excellent guide on how to properly document chronic pain care in the ED, even when opioids are not being prescribed. The Model Policy recommends that six elements be present when prescribing opioids for chronic pain.
1. Document pain treatment history
   1. (current and previous pain medications, nonpharmacological therapies, etc.
2. Document pain intensity and experience
3. Document psychiatric conditions
4. Document possible history of substance use (including alcohol)
   1. discuss with all patients any history related to the use of legal and/or illicit drugs, including prescription and nonprescription medications. Likewise, the clinician should discuss with all patients any first-degree family history related to chemical or substance abuse.
5. Document functional status
   1. documenting this can establish objectives to track treatment progress.
6. Document the treatment plan
   1. Not all states require a written treatment plan, but the Model Policy for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain recommends documenting objectives before starting opioids as a component of good medical practice. identify goals, e.g.returning to work, attending activities with their children, etc. with the patient as markers to measure progress."||0
264|228|Screen for aberrancy/abuse/addiction|0||Nearly 10% of people in drug rehabilitation have abused prescription drugs. more than half of patients who seek treatment and die do so because they used prescription drugs.There is no characteristic symptom, sign, or lab test for addiction; and there are no validated rapid tools for use in the ED to screen for abuse. Screening for addiction and abuse is difficult in a busy environment where access to medical history may be limited or unavailable. Screening for aberrant behaviors may be useful because aberrant behaviors can be indicative of addiction and misuse, but such behaviors are not diagnostic. A pattern of aberrancy may be more helpful in determining if abuse or addiction exists. Importantly, the clinician must consider oligoanalgesia as a cause for aberrant behaviors before concluding that addiction is present.||0

Most need to adhere to strict dosing protocols and an opioid contract agreement between the patient and provider may be necessary. Physicians who are unfamiliar with these situations may need the help of specialists in pain management and/or addiction medicine. These patients require a careful and thoughtful approach to care, optimally in the setting of primary care. The clinician should use the same pain management principles in patients with addiction as in other patients, but also recognize that tolerance may be present and thus require higher doses of opioids.||0

These are red flags for potential problem in the pain care plan. they may be a sign of oligoanalgesia. For example, the clinician should be concerned about a patient who presents to the emergency department with a complaint of ''running out early'' or needing a ''bridge medicine'' while under the care of a PCP/pain clinician because these behaviors are markers for unsanctioned dose escalation. No matter the time or day, the primary care or pain clinician should be notified to discuss the case further. [Guidelines suggest] we have a responsibly to appropriately evaluate/treat pain.  Do we also have a responsibility to confront any suspected abuse or addiction?  In the ED, giving the patient an opportunity for help if they wish is good care for the core problem.  When you suspect addiction or opioid abuse, be prepared to directly address it. There's evidence that the best time to intervene for patients addicted to opioids is when they are seeking opioids. 

   2. Don't prescribe to ''make them go''
       - Patients with suspected issues with medication or resource misuse, addiction, or diversion may be at risk for being inadequately evaluated/referred, but still given a prescriptionto expedite discharge.

Some may now be bankrupt, uninsured, and uninsurable by the end of their treatments and lost to follow up with their PCP. In other cases, patients may be reluctant to report symptoms for fear of being labeled complainers and they may see the ED as the only neutral place to discuss concerns.||0

   1. For survivors in our ED, we won't be making a new diagnosis of chemotherapy-related neurocognitive complications, but if we recognize their existence and their impact on the patient's ability to organize, arrange, and remember information like meds/follow-up plans, we can help. Most, after cancer treatment, hope to resume prior employment, education, leisure activities, relationships, family roles. This becomes extremely hard if long-term neurocognitive dysfunction surfaces. reintegration outside of the role of illness and healthy coping ability can be destroyed. This impacts family caregivers greatly. This entity is poorly understood, but well-described after or  during chemotherapy. The ''chemo brain'' may have impaired memory, concentration, and multitasking. In breast cancer, the best studied malignancy; neurocognitive deficits are reported as high as 50%. In various cancers, deficits may persist 10 yrs after treatment. 
3. Caregiver stress
4. Worry of recurrence
   1. most (and their families) have a lifelong fear of recurrence. they may present with an underlying concern that this recent complaint is related to return of their cancer, which is not an unfounded fear. there are few systematic studies on recurrence, but there is evidence that survivors and family caregivers have a significant fear of recurrence and that these fears will reinforce one another. Interestingly, in this dyad the family/caregiver's fear is predominant. pervasive fear and intrusive thoughts can decreases well-being, and decrease energy and engagement."||0

We should know the pearls and pitfalls of its treatment ED presentations may be for new or worsening upper/lower extremity swelling. Secondary lymphedema is most common and results from damage/removal of regional lymph nodes through surgery, radiation, infection, tumor invasion, or compression. Primary lymphedema is due to congenital absence or abnormality of the lymphatics. Lymphedema can be transient or chronic. Transient lymphedema is temporary (lasts < 6 mo) and is associated with pitting edema and lack of brawny skin changes. Consider other causes of edema, e.g. heart failure, renal/liver impairment, venous stasis; and consider recurrent malignancy with sudden onset, rapid progression, or associated pain, which may indicate direct tumor growth or metastasis in the regional lymph node basin. Lymphatics return 10% of proteins/fluids not returning by venous drainage, so if damage impairs flow. if flow is reduced >/= 80%, lymphedema occurs. abnormal pressure gradients and valvular incompetence with fibrinous changes in the lymphatic lumen, may cause shunts which carry lymphatic fluid to the interstitium. interstitial fluid can increase/alter macrophage/fibroblast activity that results in collagen deposition.

   2. Hypoalbuminemia 
      1. And secondary low oncotic pressure, decreased intravascular volume (and relative hemoconcentration), and increased fluids in interstitial spaces (edema) prevents maintenance of intravascular physiology. It is normal for some to develop relative hypotension, tachycardia, reduced urine output. Decreased intravascular volume stimulates ADH secretion and increases free-water retention causing a relative hyponatremia as water exceeds salt retention. In hypoalbuminemic patients, minimal peripheral edema indicates more normal intravascular volumes.  If a patient is hypoalbuminemic and doesn't have peripheral edema, expect significantly decreased intravascular volumes. Patients with clinical edema are not dehydrated; they have excess quantities of total body fluid and salt. With time, they may be able to reabsorb them, although not as efficiently as normal.

People who take care of the patient also suffer losses as their lives change and they share the experience with the patient. In addition to challenges, each loss also presents opportunities for new perspectives on living, heightened spiritual awareness, and chances to resolve conflicts and find greater acceptance of oneself, others, and the world. People often find ways to make these opportunities part of the adaptation to loss. Despite the ubiquitous nature of patients facing losses due to illness and despite the frequency with which physicians encounter bereaved patients and families, medical education has provided minimal training on how to provide care during this aspect of a patient's experience or on how to care for bereaved people.||0

It can be emotional, intellectual, spiritual, physical, behavioral, or social. Mourning is the act of grieving. It can involve private expressions and experiences of grief, and socially and culturally defined customs such as rituals and traditions. Mourning is the outward experience of a loss; grief and bereavement are components of the process of accommodating a loss. Immediately after a death, those who are bereaved will need time to recover from their acute stress and fatigue and to restore their environments to a more normal state. As they begin to realize the significance of the loss, they will likely experience an intense grief reaction with multiple cognitive, emotional, and physical responses and will require considerable ongoing support to help them deal with all the changes. Some people who are bereaved will make a conscious effort to deal with the loss, emotions, and changes that follow the death of a loved one and to seek ongoing assistance from their physicians to help them address their feelings of loss. Others will deny what is happening and avoid dealing with any of these issues. The latter group will be at high risk for a prolonged, complicated, grieving process.
Theoretical perspectives have offered frameworks for understanding why we grieve. Bowlby suggested that grief occurs when an attachment necessary to one's safety and security is disrupted. Others consider grief a part of the healing process that is necessary to reestablish equilibrium in a person's life after the loss of a loved one."||0
353|350|Bereavement is the state of living with a loss|0||Loss can occur at any time (for example, loss of a sense of future, function, body image, relationships, control, independence, dignity). Each loss produces a grief response and the intensity of the response will vary depending on the importance of the loss. Bereavement is associated with declines in health, inappropriate health services use, and increased risk of death. It heightens a person's risk for depression, insomnia, suicide attempts, death, and increased consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and tranquilizers.||0
354|350|Factors affecting time course of adaptation to loss.|0||Taking in the reality of a loss can take days to weeks. Adjusting to the loss can take weeks to months or even years. Interference with normal life should lessen over weeks to months, depending on the nature of the loss. Most bereaved people are able to reenter the world after one to three weeks, but they can continue to experience active grieving for a year or more. Although sadness can continue for a much longer period of time, it typically does not intrude on or prevent new life. Over a period of a year or two, most people are able to engage in relationships that have emotional meaning in the same sphere as the relationship that they had with the person who died. The time course of adaptation among terminally ill patients who are facing losses is harder to assess, but adaptation does occur. great variation in length of adaptive process. For some losses, grief continues for several months to several years. Grief may continue longer in some situations. ||0
355|350|Losses and adaptations|0||"Bonanno and others have found that psychological resilience is more common during bereavement than previously thought. These works suggest that there are multiple trajectories for the grief process, including those that involve intense, negative, emotional experiences throughout the course as well as those that involve psychological growth.
The emotional reactions to a loss are frequently volatile and may crescendo as everyone confronts the possibility that the patient may die and the changes that death will bring. Perceived loss requires adaptation. This is true whether the perceived loss is in the physical, psychological, social, or existential domain. Creative adaptations to loss can sustain a person through repeated and severe losses, but creative adaptation is not easy. For those facing cancer, the demands are often repeated and severe, and adaptation can be difficult. It is an integral part of comprehensive care to assist patients and families in achieving the adaptations that will allow them to maintain a quality existence.
Before any adaptation is likely to be an optimal fit, it is first necessary to understand the nature and the implications of a loss, discard exaggerated fears, and accept unwanted realities
However, the emotional responses to loss can be so great that comprehension is difficult. Some people need discussion and repeated fact checking. Some need a tangible event. Others simply need time to let the realities sink in.
Many people need to disconnect from their previous interests as they internally adapt and then reintegrate, without what has been lost, as a whole person who is once again ready for relationships with others."||0
356|355|Sense of future|0||One of the first losses that a patient with a life-threatening condition faces is often loss of confidence about the future. Even patients who do not lose hope probably confront this adjustment in some fashion. A serious diagnosis almost inevitably raises a person's awareness of mortality and puts it in a new light. This existential challenge is likely to have ramifications in the psychological and relational domains.||0
357|355|Self-Image|0||Physical losses and engagement in new approaches to life precipitate a changed self- image. Whether hair loss, weight loss, breast loss, or limb loss has occurred, self-image must be adjusted. It would be ideal if the patient and family could learn to feel good about the new physical form, but it is often difficult to achieve positive feelings after such a loss.||0
358|350|Roles|0||When facing serious or life-threatening illness, patients and family members may modify established roles or even take on new roles, with varying degrees of personality fit for those roles. The patient may take on the sick role and family members may take on the caregiver role. Transitions into these new roles can develop slowly or rapidly, with varying mixes of earlier roles and varying degrees of resistance and expectations of role definitions. In the sick role, the person may take on an identity of being sick. He or she expects, and is expected, to be cared for by others who tend to needs that he or she cannot fulfill alone. In the caregiving role, family members may adopt different caregiving activities and corresponding identities as they settle into expectations for the activities and resulting relationships. Role transitions can be difficult. For instance, as the patient becomes unable to perform instrumental and core activities of daily living, the caregiver must learn how to help with personal function. This type of intimacy may not be welcome because it involves different self-images and relational boundaries. A sense of loss of the patient's former self may exist for both the patient and the caregiver. It may be necessary for each party to experiment with various ways of performing the roles. The physician can help by acknowledging and normalizing the attention that these transitions require and by emphasizing that they do not always go smoothly and may demand the types of relational coping skills that family members have found helpful in other stressful adaptations. With adjustment, the caregiving role can yield gratification. It can also be accompanied by significant burdens. Caregivers experience worse health outcomes than their matched counterparts.||0

They are expected to achieve peace with others and to offer parting gestures. Dying people are expected to reach some type of conclusion on their life story or personal legacy. They are expected to make practical arrangements for material gifts and sometimes for their own death-related events, such as a funeral. They may be expected to designate successors to the roles they have held during their lives, such as asking a child to ''look after mother for me'' or asking a friend to ''see to the finances for my child.''||0
361|358|Negotiate timely role transitions|0|"   1. Family
   2. Caregiver 
"|"Although important, new roles can be detrimental if entered into prematurely. The patient can feel discarded before his or her time, and the future caregiver or future successor can feel that he or she has made serious errors in a role that he or she cared deeply about. Patients and families can be encouraged to settle their differences where possible and to enjoy the peace that results. Suggestions can be offered about making practical arrangements early, with the explicit acknowledgement that it is intended to get things squared away rather than to usher in an expected death. The notion of ''planning for the eventuality while living for quality relationships'' can be helpful. Preparations for the future may be especially helpful for close caregivers because they may have difficulty transitioning out of such an all-consuming role. In addition to the changing social roles, personal relationships are also often in transition. Personal needs change. The capacity to relate in previously habitual ways changes. The patient can feel abandoned if his or her significant other turns out to be ill-suited to the caregiver role. Family members can feel abandoned if the patient can no longer perform in the ways he or she used to. Sexual drive and capacity may change, with ensuing changes in associated meaning and emotional needs. Favorite recipes may taste different, detracting from the gratifications of cooking and eating together. The bathroom, bedroom, and living areas may be transformed by medical equipment that reminds people of sickness or death. The physician has a great deal of power to normalize the feelings associated with these changes and should remain alert to the possible need for counseling. Patient losses result in family losses. As the patient loses functions, the family tends to take up the slack. This may entail gains in roles or relationships, but there are usually losses as well. Family members may have to quit their jobs, let go of the expectations they had of a mother or spouse or child, make time to perform domestic functions, and so on. Adaptations by family members are an integral part of the process of living with a life-limiting or life-threatening illness, adjusting to losses, and to eventual bereavement. Comprehensive patient care requires an awareness of these needs and intervention that will help meet the needs. The patient is not likely to do as well if his or her family is failing to cope.

Caregiver - The cumulative effect of loss can be overwhelming for the physician and the health care team. To enhance their own effectiveness, those in the helping professions need to be keenly aware of their own vulnerability and take the necessary steps to protect themselves. Feelings of powerlessness, inadequacy, and isolation can be mitigated by utilizing self-care approaches that incorporate the mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. By balancing work life with other activities, the ED team will be able to respond more appropriately to the emotional needs of patients and their families."||0

"|Uncomplicated grief reactions include a wide range of physical, emotional, spiritual, and cognitive behaviors. The bereaved person may note feelings of hollowness in the stomach, tightness in the chest, heart palpitations, weakness, lack of energy, gastrointestinal disturbances, weight gain or loss, or skin reactions. Many say they feel emotional numbness, relief, sadness, fear, anger, guilt, loneliness, abandonment, despair, or ambivalence. The bereaved person may be concerned about cognitive symptoms such as disbelief, confusion, inability to concentrate, and preoccupation with or dreams of the deceased person. All of these are expected grief reactions to a loss. These tasks should be seen as guides for what the bereaved person may experience. Bereaved people do not go through these tasks in a scripted way, but rather in a variety of manners and with different timing for each person. Indications of uncomplicated grief include the painful yet forward movement toward incorporating the loss into one's life and beginning a meaningful life that involves entering into relationships and activities again.||0

   6. Are they available when you need them?
   7. What physical sensations do you notice when your grief is most intense?"|The way that a person copes and adapts to loss and his or her grief response is key to differentiating between a complicated and an uncomplicated grief process. In an uncomplicated grief reaction, there is an initial acute grief reaction, but the emotional response is time-limited, the individual utilizes existing resources and seeks outside help to cope and adapt to the loss, and there is no long-term impairment in daily functioning. In contrast, in complicated grief reactions the emotional response does not resolve, there is little or no adaptation to the changes that result from the loss, harmful behaviors can develop, and daily functioning is impaired. ||0
375|366|Identify Grief versus clinical depression|0||Understanding the bereaved person's preexisting conditions is beneficial because those conditions can complicate the grief process. Preexisting clinical depression, for instance, can predispose someone to a complicated grief process. Many symptoms of normal grief are similar to symptoms of mental health disorders. Discernment is helped by factoring in the intensity, duration, and impact on functioning for the bereaved. Clinical depression is a good example because both grief and depression are associated with intense low mood, difficulty with the experience of pleasure, sleep disturbance, and appetite loss, which makes it difficult to distinguish between the two. Table 1, adapted from Cook and Dworkin (1992), contrasts uncomplicated grief and clinical depression. It is important to note that, although full depressive reaction may accompany normal grief response, grief usually does not include the loss of self-esteem, worthlessness, or overall sense of guilt that characterizes depression. The depressed person has consistently low mood or an absence of emotion, has little enthusiasm for previously enjoyable activities, and has little interest in others. In contrast, the grieving person has variable emotions and is likely to shift from being able to enjoy some activities to refusing activities and from wanting to be with others to preferring to be alone. Hence, having a low threshold for inquiring about depression is appropriate when treating seriously ill patients and their families. Interventions for clinical depression that occurs during the grief process may include antidepressant or anxiolytic medication and psychotherapy. Supportive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are two psychotherapeutic approaches that are used to treat depression during the grief process. If the physician suspects depression or other psychopathology, it may be helpful to explain to the dying or bereaved person that stress may precipitate these disorders and emphasize that the associated suffering can be treated or managed.||0
376|366|Manage grief/bereavement|0||||0
377|376|Manage reactions to loss, including anxiety and depression|0||"Effectively anticipating and reducing the severity of the grief reactions of patients and families begins early in the process and involves repeated assessments of anticipated and actual losses, emotional responses, and coping strategies. Gentle inquiry may provide support to the bereaved person and may help the physician understand how the survivor is coping. Cognitive, emotional, and physical reactions to grief, and the need for bereavement support, can be ongoing for months. Physicians and health care workers need to be skilled at assessing grief reactions, providing basic supportive care, and referring individuals to bereavement experts quickly if grief reactions become complicated. It is important to recognize the underlying cause of grief in order to avoid useless or misleading investigations or medication trials. Each patient's anticipated and actual losses, emotional responses, and coping strategies must be assessed frequently during the first months following a death in order to effectively anticipate and reduce the intensity of grief reactions. Gentle inquiry can help the physician to understand how the survivor is coping and to provide support. Early in the process, try to identify individuals who are at particular risk. If religion is an important component of coping, engage a chaplain or pastoral care professional to help determine and understand the religious background and framework held by each family member. Some people will make a conscious effort to manage the loss. Others will deny what is happening and avoid dealing with the loss. Some coping strategies (eg, increased smoking/alcohol/medication intake, overworking, suicidal ideation) may accelerate and even become destructive, especially in the face of seemingly insurmountable loss. Physicians and other health care professionals need to be attuned to behaviors that might indicate complicated grief, especially if such behaviors continue beyond 6 to 12 months. The survivor may not be able to speak of the deceased person without experiencing intense sadness. Themes of loss may continue to occur in every topic during a clinical interview. Minor events may unexpectedly trigger intense grief and sadness. The survivor may be unwilling to move possessions that belonged to the deceased person. The survivor may even develop symptoms that are similar to those of the deceased person. Ongoing assessment by primary care providers will help the physician distinguish uncomplicated from complicated grief reactions. Understanding the bereaved person's preexisting conditions is beneficial because those conditions can complicate the grief process. Preexisting clinical depression, for instance, can predispose someone to a complicated grief process. 
Multiple coping strategies may be needed simultaneously. The likelihood of successful coping by bereaved people appears to improve with early intervention that uses stress- reduction techniques."||0
378|376|Acknowledges loss and adaptive responses|0||The ED is usually not the optimal site for managing grief and bereavement. However, the emergency team should know enough about grief management so that the appropriate responses and resources can be made available to the family. The physician's respect for the grief process may make a difference in the ability of the dying person and the bereaved family members to move toward their life goals. For the dying person, this may involve dying in his or her chosen way, with an intact personal identity and opportunities to complete important remaining goals. For the bereaved person, this may involve appreciation of a significant relationship, acceptance of change, and development of new life patterns and relationships. Finding adaptive responses and reintegrating is a significant accomplishment. If the physician perceives that the patient or family has begun, or even achieved, this success, it is important to acknowledge and affirm it, both to reinforce the process and to foster skills that will likely be necessary each time the patient and family face a new loss.||0
379|376|Staff Care|0||||0
380|379|Grief Education for Staff|0||Grief education for faculty and staff can be done using written material, interactive teaching sessions, and one-on-one intervention. Education should center on grief and the grief process, how to care for families, and how to care for staff.||0
381|379|Follow up with Staff|0||Debriefing sessions can be routine or episodic. They can prove particularly valuable when a death has been especially difficult for the staff, such as the death of a young person or a death that was the result of disease or trauma. Bereavement care can be particularly useful to the ED staff if they repeatedly cared for the patient who died. Caring for patients and families during the grief and bereavement process is part of comprehensive patient care. Patients respond first to the loss of their expectations for their future, and the process continues throughout the course of the illness experience. Family members have counterpart responses and many will face bereavement. It is essential that the physician understand the processes of adaptive and maladaptive response. By acknowledging and teaching the patient and family about the process of response to loss, the physician can help them adjust to illness-related losses and to the last stages of living and bereavement. Each loss results in a need to take in the reality, creative adaptation, and reintegration. Each loss and adaptation can involve experiments with coping that fail or cause stress. They can also result in deep and meaningful relationships. These important stages often leave lasting memories for families, as well as for caregivers and professionals. Care does not end until the physician has helped the family with their grief reactions and helped to provide care for those with complicated grief. It may be best to involve a social worker, pastor, or other counseling professional if interventions are necessary to treat depression during grief and for other difficult coping mechanisms for adapting to loss||0
382|376|Facilitate Discussion|0||Physicians can discern and allow for the needs of the patient and family while normalizing the process. A family meeting with the nurse, social worker, or counselor to achieve the prerequisites of an optimal adaptive process may be useful, and the physician can help orchestrate this process.||0
383|376|Encourage participatory activities/creative adaptation to losses |0||Encourage the bereaved survivor to talk about what it is like to live without the deceased. Bereaved survivors should be encouraged to participate in rituals such as the funeral or memorial services, or to identify personal rituals and write letters to family and friends that recount the story and their feelings. After a period of time in which internal reflection has allowed the bereaved person to acknowledge the loss and become capable of recreating life with the reality of the loss, encourage him or her to participate in activities with family, friends, and community. Acknowledge that, although these activities may seem meaningless at first, they may help the bereaved person to continue engagement until meaning can be recreated.||0
384|376|Refer for treatment of anxiety, depression or insomnia|0||If the loss, grief reactions, and coping strategies appear to be appropriate and effective, the situation can be monitored and supportive counseling provided. If the bereaved survivors feel they are going crazy or losing their minds, they must be given adequate time to discuss their feelings. It may also help to explain that grief is painful and prolonged, but normal; that the length of time needed for the grief process will vary with each person and situation; that there is no ''right'' way to grieve and each person will have his or her own way. If counseling is insufficient, medical management of anxiety, depression, insomnia, or other common grief reactions can be helpful for short periods of time (weeks to months).||0
385|376|Refer to resources|0||"If loss, grief reactions, and coping strategies appear to be inappropriate, ineffective, or prolonged, or they have the potential to cause harm (eg, destructive behaviors or suicide), they will need to be assessed and managed aggressively. Some people will need ongoing support, psychotherapy and/or medication to manage the symptoms and reduce the intensity and protracted course of suffering as they struggle to adapt to the profound changes in their lives. Consult a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other specialist who is skilled in complicated loss, grief, and bereavement care so that therapy can be instigated rapidly to reduce the risk of harmful or destructive activities.
Immediately after a death, those who are bereaved will need time to recover from the acute stress and fatigue, and to restore their environments back to normal. As they begin to realize the significance of the loss, they will likely experience an intense grief reaction with multiple cognitive, emotional, and physical responses (see Table 1) and will require considerable ongoing support to help them deal with all the changes. Some people who are bereaved will make a conscious effort to deal with the loss, emotions, and changes that follow the death of a loved one and will seek ongoing assistance from their physicians to help them address the feelings of loss and their emotions. Others will deny what is happening and avoid dealing with any of these issues. The latter group will be at high risk for a prolonged, complicated, grieving process.

It may be appropriate for the physician to send a condolence card and attend the patient's funeral. Many physicians and members of the professional team feel it is part of their professional duty to encourage follow-up visits from family members in order to assess the severity of their grief reactions and coping strategies and to provide support."||0
386|376|Follow through with bereaved family members after death|0||||0
387|386|Write a condolence note |0||"It has been widely reported that bereaved people felt it was helpful to receive a note or letter from the doctor after a death had occurred. Such a note has two goals: to offer tribute to the deceased person as someone who was important and to be a source of comfort to the survivors. Mourners will appreciate that the physician took the time to sit and compose a personal message to them or to share a memory of the deceased person. A promptly sent letter (generally within two weeks after the death) will be far more effective than a late one. The note should be handwritten on any standard stationery. Here are some specific guidelines for writing a good condolence note: Acknowledge the loss and name the deceased person. This sets the purpose and tone of the letter. Express your sympathy. Use words of sympathy that remind the bereaved that they are not alone in their feelings of sadness and loss, such as, ''I am sure she will be missed by many.''vIf you got to know the person at all, note special qualities of the deceased person. Acknowledge those characteristics that you observed about the person who has died. These might be qualities of personality (courage, sensitivity), or attributes (funny, affable), or ways the person related to the world (religious, devoted to community welfare). Say something like, ''I will miss her sense of humor.''	If relevant, recall a memory about the deceased person. Talk about how the deceased person touched your life. Try to capture what it was about the person in the story that you admired, appreciated, or respected. You may use humor-the funny stories are often the most appreciated by those who are bereaved. Say something like, '''I particularly remember when she had all of us in the office laughing at one of her jokes about the examination gown.'' Consider reminding the bereaved people of their personal strengths.Bereavement often brings self-doubt and anxiety about one\'s own personal worth. Reminding bereaved people of the qualities that they possess will help get them through this period and reinforce their ability to cope. Qualities to mention might be patience, optimism, religious belief, resilience, and competence. Offer help, but be specific. Don't say, ''If there is anything I can do, please call.'' That puts a burden on those in grief who may be totally at a loss about what needs to be done. A definite offer of help is more appreciated. Whatever you offer, do it. Don\'t make an offer you cannot fulfill. You may want to say something such as ''I'd be happy to answer any questions you or your family might have about her illness and her care. Just make an appointment-no charge.'' End with a word or phrase of sympathy, such as, ''I'll remember your mother and the care you gave her.''"||0
388|386|Help from the interdisciplinary team|0||Professional members of the interdisciplinary team can also offer to assist family members (when they are ready) to deal with outstanding practical matters, secure documents to redeem insurance, find legal counsel to execute the will, meet financial obligations, close the estate, etc.||0
389|386|Bereavement visit|0||The physician can assist bereaved people who have uncomplicated grief by asking how they are coping, educating them about the grief process, and normalizing the experience. Simply offering a bereavement visit as a routine matter will help to normalize the experience. Grief counseling and support may be helpful for persons who experience uncomplicated grief. Although these individuals may not need professional intervention, they may benefit from opportunities to learn more about the grief process, to express emotions with others who have similar feelings, and to receive guidance with problem-solving as they adjust to life without the deceased person. In addition to individual, general, and specialty group counseling, hospice and palliative care programs typically provide a wide range of bereavement services, including support newsletters, memorial celebrations, and specific strategies to help cope with holidays and particular types of loss. If the patient was enrolled in hospice care, family members may be eligible for bereavement support services without charge through that hospice. Other bereaved individuals may be able to access those services for a fee||0

But, if the survivor says, ''I think she might be dead'' you may  feel awkward making the quicker than expected transition to, ''Yes, I am sorry to say that she is dead.'' Even if survivors were on-scene, they will likely know little about what happened and may not understand what they saw. Survivors may feel especially annoyed by this approach, if are now anxious or were kept waiting, when what they really want to hear now is the status of their loved one. if you use this first approach, hone it to prepare for a wide variety of responses.||0

If for some reason you did not get appropriate sign out, gather information from the chart, look at the body for identifiers, and if necessary call members of the previous team to get information. In death disclosure you accepted in sign out, you might tell survivors [you] weren't actually present and didn't treat the patient.

Therefore, we (EP's) are currently unlikely to manage dying; ironically, especially in those who do not want aggressive care. But, if we can recognize the ''syndrome of imminent death'', we can manage physical and psychological symptoms in a fragile, and key time of a life for those who won't die by withdrawing life support. ||0

Rapidly detecting if the patient/family are unable to accept the notion of impending death, whether they've discussed resuscitation status, whether they have the resources to care for the patient, and whether they are having trouble transitioning from aggressive care to symptom management are skills to hone.

An algorithm may include progressive steps (1) immediately treating symptoms and suffering regardless of next steps, (2) rapid goals assessment, (3) negotiation of goals, and (4) reaching consensus about goals. Most need few or no tests and procedures if the goal is comfort. If the goal is to delay death maybe to achieve some other goals, fluids, antibiotics, other low-risk interventions, labs or radiographs may be appropriate. If goals are aggressive to fully reverse/improve the current state, you may order a number of things you feel are of limited effectiveness and benefit.||0

That said, any setting with prepared and supported professionals, family, and/or volunteer caregivers can care for the actively dying. If a home or non-hospital death is preferred, make a referral to an out- or inpatient hospice. Depending on time of day, they may be able to accommodate a patient with hours to live. If not, the ED must accommodate as best it can. the best environment is private/intimate and allows family/friends continuous access without disturbing others.

Combined with the fact that EP's are trained to save lives, it can be hard for us to allow and even recognize natural death.  We must look beyond acute compromises in the A/B/C's, none of which may be present until the last minutes of chronic illness. And, imminent death may look like sepsis, electrolyte abnormality, acute CNS events, MI, etc, and.or may have elements of all of these processes as the body naturally shuts down.

Moving the patient (every 1-2 hours) can avoid joint discomfort and pressure ulcers.  To prevent ulcers, turn patient from side to side every 1-1.5 hours and protect bony prominences with hydrocolloid dressings and special supports.

Continuous pain in the semiconscious or obtunded patient is difficult to assess, but may be associated with grimacing and continuous facial tension across the forehead and between the eyebrows. Do not over-diagnose constant pain when fleeting forehead tension comes and goes with movement or mental activity (dreams or hallucinations, for example). Consider the possibility of pain with physiologic indicators, e.g. transient tachycardia. Do not confuse pain with the restlessness, agitation, moaning, and groaning of terminal delirium. If unclear, trialing a higher dose of opioid may answer whether pain is driving the behaviors. Knowing opioid pharmacology is critical during last hours of life. The liver conjugates codeine, morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone into glucuronides. Some of their metabolites remain active as analgesics until renally cleared, particularly morphine. dying patients will all have diminishing liver/renal function, and usually become olig- or anuric. Continuing routine doses/infusions of morphine may lead to increased levels of active metabolites, toxicity, and risk of terminal delirium.||0
481|478|Decreasing appetite/fluid intake|0||Most also reduce fluid intake, or stop drinking entirely, long before death. If still taking some fluid, but not eating, salty fluids e.g. soups, club soda, sport drinks, and red vegetable juices can balance  electrolytes and minimize nausea from hyponatremia. Decreased intake usually distresses onlookers who worry the dehydrated patient will suffer, particularly if she becomes thirsty. We can comfort them by helping them understand that most experts in the field feel that the natural dehydration  in the last hours doesn't distress the dying, and it may even stimulate endorphins. Low blood pressure or weak pulse is part of natural dying, not an indicator of dehydration. Patients unable to move don't get lightheaded. Patients with peripheral edema or ascites have excess body water and salt and are not dehydrated. Consider IV or SQ fluids using hypodermoclysis, particularly if the goal is to reverse delirium. Excess parenteral fluids can lead to fluid overload and peripheral/pulmonary edema, worsened breathlessness, cough, and orotracheobronchial secretions, particularly in hypoalbuminemia.

484|478|Neurologic Dysfunction|0||||0
485|484|Two Roads to Death|0||The neurological changes of dying result from multiple, concurrent, nonreversible factors (hypoxemia; metabolic imbalance; acidosis; toxin accumulation due to liver and renal failure; adverse effects of meds; sepsis; disease-related factors; reduced cerebral perfusion). They may manifest in two patterns described as the ''two roads to death''. The ''usual road'' that 70-90% of patients follow is decreasing levels of consciousness leading to coma/death. The ''difficult road'' that 10-30% of patients follow is an agitated delirium due to CNS excitation-with or without myoclonic jerks-leading to coma/death. Focal or grand mal seizures are more likely along the difficult road, particularly with cerebral metastases. The patient is increasingly drowsy, sleeps most if not all of the time, and eventually becomes unarousable. Absence of eyelash reflex indicates a deep coma equivalent to full anesthesia.||0
486|484|Terminal delirium |0||Delirium may be the first sign to herald the difficult road. It may manifest as confusion, restlessness, and/or agitation, with or without day-night reversal. It may result from any of the standard causes of delirium listed in the DSM. Agitated terminal delirium can be very distressing to those who don't understand it. Although previous care may have been excellent, if delirium is misdiagnosed or unmanaged, family will likely remember a horrible, painful death, and fear their own death will be the same. Reassure that what they see may be very different from what the patient experiences. If delirium presents in the non-actively dying patient, you may try to reverse treatable contributors knowing this is effective in a minority of cases if the patient is close to the last hours of his or her life. Although moaning, groaning, and grimacing accompany agitation and restlessness, they are frequently misinterpreted as pain.||0

Accessory respiratory muscle use may become prominent. A few, sometimes many, last reflex breaths may signal death. Patients and caregivers are often distressed at the mere thought of breathlessness.

493|478|Inability to swallow/death rattle|0|Loss of gag reflex, Buildup of saliva, secretions|In the last hours of life, weakness and decreased neurological function frequently impair the patient's ability to swallow. The gag reflex and reflexive clearing of the oropharynx decline and secretions from the tracheobronchial tree accumulate. These conditions may become more prominent as the patient loses consciousness. Buildup of saliva and oropha- ryngeal secretions accumulate and may lead to gurgling, crackling, or rattling sounds with each breath. Some have called this the death rattle, a term frequently disconcerting to families and caregivers. For unprepared families and professional caregivers, it may sound like the patient is choking.Once the patient is unable to swallow, oral intake should be stopped. Warn families and professional caregivers of the risk of aspiration. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the earlier treatment is initiated, the better it works because larger amounts of secretions in the upper aerodigestive tract are more difficult to eliminate. However, premature use in the patient who is still alert may lead to unacceptable drying of oral and pharyngeal mucosa.||0

"|"These will effectively reduce the production of saliva and other secretions. They will minimize or eliminate the gurgling and crackling sounds, and may be used prophylactically in the unconscious dying patient.

Although atropine IV 0.1mg may be equally effective, it has an increased risk of producing undesired cardiac and/or CNS excitation. "||0
495|493|Repositioning|0||If excessive fluid accumulates in the back of the throat and upper airways, it may need to be cleared by repositioning the patient or by postural drainage. Turning the patient onto one side or a semi-prone position may reduce gurgling. Lowering the head of the bed and raising the foot of the bed while the patient is in a semi-prone position may cause fluids to move into the oropharynx, from which they can be easily removed. Do not maintain this position for more than a few minutes at a time, as stomach contents may also move unexpectedly.||0

501|499|Describing death|0||Because dying in contemporary society is highly medicalized, most people have not witnessed a natural human death. For this reason, it is likely that many families and caregivers will not fully understand a patient's natural death process and this may cause them undue suffering. Averting such a situation requires that families and caregivers be given the proper information regarding how the body shuts down.  Case Based teaching point: An 89-year-old woman with adult failure to thrive and multiple episodes of sepsis presents with altered mental status. Labs reveal a serum sodium of 168mEg/dl. The patient has been unable to eat, drink, or swallow over the last month. Here is one example of how to communicate this information: ''The body is shutting down because the (disease) is taking over the body. The natural process is that the patient stops eating and drinking and that the brain begins to send and receive a different set of signals. The normal balance of chemicals in the blood becomes altered and the patient goes into a different state. We embrace all of this as normal for dying and we support each patient through this process.''||0
502|499|Describing intervening on death|0||'When the person no longer has the ability to eat or drink on their own, we expect the blood to become off balance as a natural process.

We could interfere with this process temporarily by introducing a feeding tube or starting and maintaining intravenous fluids. We need to weigh if we should do this or not.''||0

That said, care of the actively dying can be provided in any setting as long as the professional, family, and volunteer caregivers are appropriately prepared and supported throughout the process. If the patient, caregivers, or family desires a home or nonhospital death, the emergency department should initiate a referral to an outpatient or inpatient hospice. Depending on the day and hour, hospices may be able to accommodate care for the actively dying with only hours to live. If not, the ED must accommodate as best it can.The environment must allow family and friends access to their loved one around the clock without disturbing others and should be conducive to privacy and intimacy. Try to find a bay in the least trafficked area of the ED or in the holding area if there is one and bring in chairs for the family.

"|Dying patients will often have issues with IV access, and it is important, therefore, to consider the oral/buccal/sublingual, transdermal, subcutaneous, and rectal routes. Morphine, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), fentanyl, and sufentanil can all be safely administered as a continuous SQ infusion with a maximal 3cc/hr infusion rate. A useful and easy hydration technique is hypodermoclysis, the subcutaneous infusion of fluids. The method is safe and does not carry any significant complications. Mild edema at the sight may be common. Approximately 3 L can be given in a 24-hour period at two separate sites. Common infusion sites are the chest, abdomen, thighs, and upper arms. The preferred solution is normal saline, but other solutions (such as half-normal saline, glucose with saline, or 5 percent glucose) can also be used. If needed, potassium chloride can be added to the solution bag. To enhance fluid absorption, hyaluronidase can also be added. Hypodermoclysis can be administered at home by family members or a nurse and the technique should be familiar to every family physician.||0
510|472|In terminal Delirium|0||When moaning, groaning, and grimacing accompany agitation and restlessness, they are frequently misinterpreted as pain. However, it is a myth that pain suddenly develops during the last hours of life when it was not previously out of control. Although a trial of opioids may be beneficial in the unconscious patient who is difficult to assess, physicians must remember that opioids may accumulate and add to the delirium when renal clearance is poor (see Module 11: Chronic Pain). Rarely, the trial of increased opioids does not relieve the agitation or makes the delirium worse by increasing agitation or pre- cipitating myoclonic jerks or seizures. If so, alternate therapies directed at suppressing the symptoms associated with the delirium should be pursued.||0

In the 1980s, the standard practice of uniformly excluding family members during resuscitation was questioned after research showed that family members often felt powerless, frustrated, and upset after sudden death of a loved one and that the team had not told them what they wanted to know. Families continued to request to be present in resuscitation attempts. Still, this practice is much debated among EP's. It's estimated that 20% of the estimated forty-thousand annual pediatric deaths occur in the prehospital or ED setting. Pediatric death violates our perceptions about how death should occur, so is particularly hard for families and teams, so from necessity in practice; family-centered, team-oriented approaches have been fairly widely adopted in pediatric centers. ||0

521|519|Pediatric experience|0||Pediatricians are more likely to accept FWR and to make repeated attempts at FWR than their counterparts in adult medicine. In a survey of >1,200 pediatric emergency and critical care physicians, nearly all had participated in FWR and felt families should be allowed to view the process. But they also acknowledged the practice as stressful and feel house staff need training in the practice. It was also shown that inpatient-oriented pediatric specialists are far more accepting of family presence and more willing to repeat FWR. During their residencies, pediatric-trained physicians are often faced with performing resuscitations in the delivery room while parents are present so may be more comfortable with the experience.||0
522|519|The family view|0||Doyle et al. pioneered work in ED FWR at Foote Hospital in Jackson, Michigan in the mid-1980s. In this study, family were given an option of being present in critical resuscitations. Interviews afterwards of participating respondents showed that FWR was an overall positive experience.. Being present fostered allowed family to appreciate the efforts made and an opportunity to assume a more active and involved role. Of the 47 respondents, 44 (94%) said they'd choose to be present again if asked. 36 (76%) said they thought the experience facilitated their adjustment to the death, and 30 (64%) believed their presence was helpful to the dying family member.

525|519|Fear of litigation|0||Some argue that the physician's willingness to include the family fosters increased trust. Some authors advocate that improved communication and reassurance will lessen the likelihood of litigation.||0
526|519|Negative effects on families|0||Interestingly, a long-term follow-up of Foote Hospital's continued FWR program found that anticipated negative effects on family members failed to occur. Other studies of FWR have yielded consistently positive responses from participating families, and one randomized, controlled trial was ended early because ED staff became convinced of its benefit to families.||0
527|519|Stress on clinicians|0||It can be an added stress on, especially younger, physicians. But, training and experience increases comfort level with FWR. Anecdotal reports and one study suggest that health care professionals who experience FWR first-hand often undergo a change of attitude about its benefits.||0
528|519|Limitations in the literature|0||Although the literature strongly suggests the benefits of FWR, the limitations in the literature are significant enough that a definitive conclusion cannot be reached.

Painful and invasive interventions will always be unequivocally beneficial in most cases, and it's impossible to fully conceptualize all benefits and burdens for one patient, especially if we don't routinely see/know that patient, but we are responsible to strive to know how each patient perceives benefits/burdens of interventions, and e.g. recognize when limiting those interventions aligns with that patient's end of life goals.  This is especially true if the goals are ill-defined or the diagnosis is unclear.  We must be leaders in discussing life-sustaining treatments. Patients/families frequently depend on us to educate, assist with deliberation, and make recommendations. We are further responsible to document and support the appropriate orders. Advance directives may help if present, or may not clearly translate general goals into a plan for the presentation.

542|541|Artificial nutrition/hydration|0||We must negotiate artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) frequently. ''Isn't she starving?'' or ''Isn't he dehydrated?'' are common questions in the ED and can be a primary reason for presentation. For some, the decision can be made in the next care setting, but for others (e.g., those who'll return home or go to hospice), it must be made in the ED. So we must know the evidence and the patient's goals of care. It has been suggested that even small amounts of carbohydrates may paradoxically lead to increased discomfort. this is based on studies that showed that normal healthy subjects who voluntarily fasted become anorectic, but they sensed hunger when given small amounts of carbohydrates (that quickly diminish ketone production). In chronic illness, there is a normal and gradual decrease in food and water intake that culminates in cessation of oral intake. Family and caregivers may be concerned about hunger, but there is no evidence that artificial nutrition or hydration makes a person feel less hungry. Terminally ill patients who are alert and capable of decision making usually do not complain of hunger near the end of life. If they do, it can be satisfied with very small amounts of food. Persons with advanced cancer have an increase in threshold for hunger (decreased taste) and may have decreased hypothalamic stimulation secondary to diminished gastric contractions. Dehydration may be functional to dying in advanced cancer and may allow comfort because the natural effect of dehydration is hypernatremia with accompanying altered mental status. Dry mouth and thirst are best relieved with oral swabs, lip vaseline, and ice chips. Dehydration leads to a decreased production in all bodily fluids including urine output, gastrointestinal secretions, pulmonary and pharyngeal secretions, and edema. The benefits of this decreased production are seen in the decreased need for incontinence care, decreased nausea and vomiting, and a decreased need for suctioning. Controlled trials have demonstrated that terminally ill patients who forego ANH have less discomfort than those who receive intravenous hydration.||0

   6. ANH does not produce consistent reversal of the metabolic abnormalities of diseased"|Because food and water are widely held to be forms of caring, the withholding of ANH may be misperceived as neglect by the patient, family, or other professional and volunteer caregivers. Patients and caregivers will present to the emergency department and request artificial nutrition or hydration because they fear that the patient will die without these elements. Clinicians must be able to distinguish between the terms food and artificial nutrition and hydration. ANH are medical therapies that require a physician's order, whereas food may be accessed by individuals with or without the physician's assistance. ANH must be administered via technical procedures that require medical personnel. The ingestion of food does not require such procedures or personnel. If the clinician holds personal values and beliefs regarding the ability to distinguish between food and ANH, he or she must either prioritize medical norms and accepted patient preferences or take steps to withdraw from the case to avoid violating his or her conscience. Patients with advanced cancer or dementia often present to the ED at the end of life and request that artificial fluids and nutrition be initiated.||0

Research shows no consistent effect of artificial nutrition on morbidity or mortality in patients with advanced cancer and malnutrition. ANH does not produce consistent reversal of the metabolic abnormalities that occur in the diseased state. In fact, some studies have shown decreased survival in patients who were given aggressive nutritional support, possibly as a result of complications of the therapy and enhancement of tumor growth. The final decision regarding ANH should be weighed after an assessment of all of the factors involved. Most importantly, the recommendation for or against ANH should be thoughtful. It is often assumed that ANH should be provided if patients or families request it. A recommendation for ANH in advanced cancer should be consistent with the goals of care.

551|539|Information is lacking: implied consent|0||Information is often scant in the ED, particularly during the first few minutes of an emergency response. The urgency of the situation is not conducive to meaningful or thorough conversations between the ED team and the patient, and family members are sometimes not available. The emergency clinician most likely will not immediately know the cause of the medical crisis, nor will he or she have a good grasp of how chronic illness has affected the patient. Medical records may become available, the patient's primary care physician may be reachable, and family members may arrive at the ED, but these events will most likely occur after the initial attempts to stabilize the patient. Indeed, it is most often the case that emergency clinicians use implied consent to assume that the patient wants to live and thus they initiate diagnostics and treatments without obtaining informed consent. goals of care are paramount to how much, why, and what makes sense and what doesn't for a patient's care. Patients often come to the ED in a crisis that might have been expected or anticipated given their chronic illness, yet goals of care have not been addressed so it is unclear how to respond. The ethical obligation then falls to the emergency clinician to assess, inform, and advise patients and surrogates about intervention based on disease trajectory, prognosis, and clinical effectiveness of therapies. If immediate intervention is necessary to sustain life, but clarifying discussions later reveal that such intervention is not appropriate, then withdrawal is usually appropriate.||0

553|539|Patients and surrogates may not have discussed goals of care prior to ED stay|0||EMS are often accessed by those with terminal disease or are actively dying (or by their families). Our role may be essential. Patients who present to the ED have frequently not engaged in deliberations regarding life-sustaining treatments. Even if some discussion about life-sustaining treatment has occurred, the patient's goals and wishes may not have been communicated clearly to those people who will be called on to assist in decision making (eg, family, caregivers, and surrogates). ||0

556|539|ED is programmed to institute life sustaining interventions|0||The classic role of the EP is to preserve life: we must fully commit to succeed in tension pneumothorax, respiratory failure, pericardial tamponade, or ventricular fibrillation. these simple techniques are vital to our training/practice. we are taught, implicitly or explicitly, to not withhold potentially life-saving interventions unless there are clear instructions from the patient/surrogate to limit efforts, so we are understandably most comfortable with initiating and not withdrawing aggressive therapy. CPR and cardiac life support are early core skills in our educational model||0
557|539|Starting then stopping: withdraw/withhold or both?|0||The appropriateness of withholding or withdrawing such therapies once they have been initiated, however, has been poorly taught in emergency practice. Emergency practitioners sometimes find themselves interrupting a dying process with ED interventions for a patient who understands that death is imminent, expected, and perhaps even welcomed. It may sometimes become clear only after stabilization of a life threat that the emergency interventions used are unwanted by the patient or are evidently misaligned with the patient's previously stated end-of-life goals. When the support systems seem to take on an imperative of their own, this can be disconcerting to an ED team as well as distressing or even devastating to the patient and family. Concerns about starting and then stopping a treatment are real for emergency providers. One may feel that stopping ventilation or a cardiac pacemaker is akin to killing the patient. The act of omission (the failure to intervene) may feel ethically safer than the act of commission in stopping an artificial means that has sustained a patient's life. Ethicists have pointed out that withdrawal in the emergency setting can be morally superior to withholding treatments or hesitating to intervene when immediate action is called for because such interventions buy time that may allow for a fuller understanding of the patient's situation and wishes. If withdrawal is in order, the emergency clinician must have the knowledge, attitude, and skills necessary to withdraw support in a manner that imparts dignity and comfort to the patient and keeps within the constraints of professional ethics. ||0

"|Emergency clinicians are comfortable with initiating treatments and therapies in the emergency setting and do so on a daily basis. Among life-sustaining treatments, they tend to be more comfortable with termination of CPR because the clinical expectation of the patient's status is clear: the patient has died. After cessation of CPR, attention is usually focused on the care of the family and the clinical team. In some situations, however, the clinician may be asked to withdraw therapies from a patient who is still considered to be alive, leaving family and caretakers to witness the patient's last moments. This can involve physical distress for the patient. It can also leave lifelong traumatic memories for family members. A poorly managed therapy withdrawal can also become imprinted on a clinician's mind and may become a barrier to enhancing his or her skill set.||0
560|538|A framework for withdrawing and withholding non-beneficial treatments|0||Emergency providers can be reassured that the professional culture of the specialty will support them when their decision to withhold or withdraw therapies is based on sound ethical, legal, and medical principles. The American College of Emergency Physicians, the Society for Academic Medicine, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, the Emergency Nurses Association, and the National Association of Emergency Medical Service Providers have issued statements or policies that support the limitation and withdrawal of therapies in the emergency setting if such therapies are either unwanted by the patient or medically inappropriate.||0

As a rule, the discussion of goals of care should precede the recommendation of specific treatment preferences; this will guide the clinician to discuss relevant options. The clinician usually initiates discussions of treatment preferences, but other appropriate members of the health care team can enhance the discussion and prevent subsequent conflict within the team. They may have fewer time constraints and thus be able to continue the dialogue with the patient and family. The team can also be able to provide valuable emotional support to the patient, family, and each other.||0

"|To function in a sphere of global wellness, the ED team must be considerate of multiple perspectives. There must be a coordinated effort to ensure open communication and support of all team members. Prehospital providers are at particular risk for being criticized for initiating interventions that may later be deemed inappropriate and this can lead to self-reproach. This attitude is counterproductive and can impede patient care because the team then begins to focus on dysfunctions and gaps rather than optimizing and correcting situations. The anxieties of patients, families, lay caregivers, and the emergency providers often rise as a patient nears death. A discussion of withdrawing and withholding therapies that are not beneficial can be difficult if one member of the ED team wants to limit care and the remainder of the team favors employing life-extending therapies. This can lead to dysfunction at the bedside, confusion for the patient and family, and strain on working relationships. All members of the team must take responsibility to work within a framework of support, feedback, and respect.||0
563|560|Know local/state/national policies and statutes|0||Clinicians must familiarize themselves with the institutional policies and pertinent statutes in their practice area. Institutional policies are written in response to the general legal imperative to emergency medical care providers that they must opt for treatment that will prolong life if any doubt exists about the patient's wishes. Institutional policies of many health care facilities include considerations that are intended to protect the institution from risk. However, most states allow the patient and clinician to decide on specific treatments. Each institution has its own policies and may have developed standard forms for use with life-sustaining treatment. All states in the United States have statutes that cover issues related to withholding or withdrawing of life-sustaining treatments. Prehospital personnel are regulated by statute, and sometimes also by city ordinance. Although requirements vary, prehospital personnel are often required to provide all resuscitative and life- prolonging treatments unless a physician's order to the contrary is in place.||0

572|538|Ventilator withdrawal in the ED|0||Do not delay withdrawal as a way of avoiding the issue. The withdrawal of ventilator support is one of the most challenging situations for patients, families, and members of the health care team. With the realities of ED overcrowding and ''boarding,'' patients often receive intensive care in the ED. Long waits for intensive care unit beds often require that the ED team be involved in decisions such as ventilator withdrawal. Or a patient may have been placed on a ventilator in the prehospital setting or in the ED when little information was known, with the subsequent discovery of a medical directive that excludes the use of ventilation and resuscitation. Or appropriate surrogates may insist that the patient would not want the aggressive measures that are being undertaken and request cessation of efforts. Emergency clinicians should respect the wishes of the patient and the surrogates as much as possible. Due diligence in establishing that withdrawal is, indeed, appropriate is a necessity, but once done the clinician should not delay withdrawal as a way of avoiding the issue (eg, do not needlessly wait until transfer to the ICU). In discussing whether to institute or withdraw artificial ventilation, the clinician should follow the general outline for discussing life-sustaining treatments and employ a team approach, including the nurse, social worker, chaplain, and emergency medical services personnel as appropriate.||0
573|572|Prepare the patient and family|0||After it has been established that the patient or surrogate desires withdrawal, the stage must be properly set despite the constraints of the ED. If possible, the patient and family should have a private room and preparation should be made to ensure that they will not have to be moved if another critical patient arrives.The family should be involved in the decision to withdraw the ventilator. They should understand the procedure and be reassured about their roles. Because of the degree of uncertainty involved, it is also important for the clinician to prepare the family for the range of outcomes that might occur. The ED team should never make assumptions about what the family understands. The clinician should describe the procedure in clear, simple terms and answer any questions||0
574|573|Set the stage|0||If ventilator withdrawal seems appropriate to everyone involved, two methods of withdrawal should be considered: (1) immediate extubation and (2) terminal weaning. The choice of which method to use will be influenced by the patient's comfort, the family's perceptions, and the clinician's assessment. It is critical that the patient be comfortable both throughout the withdrawal procedure and afterward. The most important and prevalent symptoms of ventilator withdrawal are breathlessness and anxiety.||0
575|573|Establish a preference regarding consciousness|0||If the patient is conscious, it must be determined whether he or she would like to remain conscious as the ventilator is withdrawn. This will determine the endpoints for initial medication and guide the use of additional medication during the procedure. If the patient wishes to remain awake, opioids and benzodiazepines should be initiated at low doses. Plans should be in place to intervene if severe breathlessness or discomfort ensues after extubation. The clinician should also discuss how and when it may become necessary to titrate to an endpoint of sedation||0
576|573|Set expectations|0||The family should be made aware of what is likely to happen. The family and caregivers should be assured that the patient's comfort is of primary concern. The ED team should explain that breathlessness and discomfort may occur, but medications will be available to manage these symptoms.The family should discuss ahead of time the possibility that occasionally it is necessary to induce sleep in the patient to manage symptoms. The family should understand how terminal sedation is distinct from hastening death (see also ''Terminal sedation and the doctrine of double effect'' below). They should be aware that involuntary moving or gasping need not reflect suffering if the patient is properly sedated or in a coma.In spite of efforts to avoid distress, perfection is rare. For instance, efforts can be made to avoid the sound of the ''death rattle'' (see also below ''Secretion management / death rattle'') but accumulation of fluid deep in the trachea may occur which can be distressing to the family. The family should be reassured that this is a natural process and does not indicate that the patient is in distress.||0
577|573|Encourage touch and interaction|0||The family should be encouraged to show love and support by talking to or touching the patient, stroking the patient's forehead, or holding the patient's hand.||0
578|573|Explain uncertainty after withdrawal|0||The clinician should explain that there is always some uncertainty about what will happen after the ventilator is withdrawn. Some patients die within several minutes, but others may live for longer periods. The family should be cautioned that although death is expected, it is not certain. Data show that approximately 10% of patients survive ventilator withdrawal and are discharged from the hospital.||0
579|573|Establish DNR status|0||This step establishes a concrete expectation by the family of the patient's death. It is also part of providing for important relevant orders and documentation and it prevents inappropriate calls for resuscitation.||0

581|580|Meet in advance to discuss plan for care|0||The ED team (physician, primary nurse, charge nurse, and, ideally, also the technicians, respiratory therapist, pharmacist, chaplain, and social worker) should meet in advance to discuss the plan of care. If at all possible, the withdrawal procedure should not be scheduled during a shift change||0
582|580|Symptom control|0||The ED team should anticipate potential discomfort and institute appropriate medical and nonmedical measures in advance in order to prevent occurrence of these symptoms. Medication should be immediately available at the bedside so that it can be rapidly titrated to the level appropriate to ensure the patient's comfort. The ED team should ensure that the patient is comfortable before withdrawing the ventilator and also verbally reassure the patient and the family that he or she will be kept comfortable throughout the process and afterward.||0
583|582|Terminal sedation and the doctrine of double effect|0||Occasionally, refractory symptoms lead the patient, family, and professional team to conclude that the only option for securing comfort for the patient is sedation. If it is not possible to lighten the sedation without a return to unbearable suffering, this sedation can be terminal. Terminal sedation has been somewhat controversial. Terminal sedation should not be conducted without involvement of senior experts||0
584|572|Decide mode of withdrawal|0||The emergency clinician should have a plan for the mode of ventilator withdrawal and should reach clinical consensus with the nurses, respiratory therapist, and any other members of the team who will be at the bedside and interact with the family. The ED team must be coordinated and work in concert so that families and patients do not become uncomfortable with any hesitancy or bedside confusion regarding the plan.||0
585|584|Immediate extubation|0||In immediate extubation, the endotracheal tube is removed after appropriate premedication and suctioning. Humidified air or oxygen is given to prevent drying of the airway. This is the preferred approach to relieve discomfort if the patient is conscious, the secretions volume is low, and the airway is unlikely to be compromised after extubation. Although most authorities regard immediate extubation as ethically sound practice, some may experience it as intentionally ending the patient's life. Provided the intent is to allow natural death from the terminal condition, and provided guidelines endorsed by a medical professional body are carefully followed, this is not killing. Nonetheless, emotional experience of what it feels like is important and procedures that feel wrong should be avoided whenever possible, replacing them with an approach that feels appropriate.||0
586|584|Terminal weaning|0||In what some have called terminal weaning, the ventilator rate, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and oxygen levels are decreased while the endotracheal tube is left in place. Terminal weaning may be carried out over a period of 30 to 60 minutes or longer. Narcosis from accumulating carbon dioxide may stimulate endorphin release that further sedates the patient. Often, the endotracheal tube can be left in place with a Briggs T-piece in place of the ventilator. Alternatively, the patient may be extubated.||0
587|584|Address symptoms of extubation|0||The clinician or assisting nurse should have a syringe of a sedating medication such as midazolam, lorazepam, or diazepam ready to use in case distressing tachypnea or other symptoms occur. ||0
588|587|Breathlessness|0||Opioids (such as morphine) are the most effective medication for relieving the sense of breathlessness. They work through both central and peripheral mechanisms of action. The principle of intended versus unintended consequences governs the use of opioids in this setting Concerns about unintended secondary effects, such as shortened life, are exaggerated, particularly if established dosing guidelines are followed. The dose should be titrated with the intent of achieving comfort. Doses that are increased beyond the level needed to achieve comfort or sedation can hasten death and constitute euthanasia. Oxygen is helpful to correct hypoxemia, but may not relieve breathlessness (see Module 10: Common Symptoms). An opioid-nai?ve patient should be given a bolus dose of 2 to 10 mg of morphine IV to prevent breathlessness.||0
589|587|Anxiety |0||Benzodiazepines such as midazolam and lorazepam are the most effective anxiolytic drugs in this setting and are usually used in combination with opioids for severe breathlessness. Opioids have transient and unreliable anxiolytic effects in opioid-nai?ve patients and should not be used for this purpose. When persistent dyspnea is expected, initial opioid doses should be followed with a continuous morphine infusion at 50% of bolus dose/h to maintain the desired effect. An infusion at 1 mg/h can be started after a bolus of midazolam. Both medications should be titrated to minimize anxiety and achieve the desired state of comfort and sedation. Lorazepam may be used as an alternative. Higher doses will be required if these medications have been routinely used and pharmacologic tolerance develops. There is no need to increase the doses once comfort and the desired level of sedation have been achieved. Aggressive symptom control is needed if distress ensues once the ventilator has been withdrawn. The clinician may wish to consider using morphine, 5 to 10 mg IV push q 10 min, and/or midazolam, 2 to 4 mg IV push q 10 min, until distress is relieved. Both infusion rates should be adjusted to maintain relief. The doses recommended here are intended for patients who have not previously taken anxiolytic medications or opioids.||0
590|587|Secretion rattle |0||Appropriate plans to prevent the gurgling sound of secretions in the airway (known as the death rattle) should be made in advance. This may include the use of an anticholinergic agent such as IV glycopyrolate, atropine, or scopolamine. The ED team and the family should be educated about the physiological aspects of death rattle and its implications, including the fact that it does not signify respiratory distress or choking||0
591|587|Set FiO2 to 21%|0||Once initial symptom control has been established, the FiO2 on the ventilator should be set to 21% and the patient should be observed for signs of respiratory distress.||0
592|587|Observe patient and control symptoms|0||Opioids and benzodiazepines should be adjusted to relieve distress before proceeding further. If a patient is likely to develop CO2 narcosis with a decrease in ventilator settings, he or she may be less in need of sedating medications. If the patient appears comfortable, preparation for removal of the endotracheal tube should begin. ||0
593|587|Deflate ET tube cuff, turn off ventilator, and get out of way|0||||0
594|587|Remove tube beneath a clean towel|0||The clinician may wish to try a few moments of ''no assist'' before the endotracheal tube is removed. When ready to proceed, the endotracheal (ET) tube cuff should be deflated. If possible, an ED team member should be available to silence the ventilator, turn it off, and move it out of the way. Once the cuff is deflated, the ET tube should be removed underneath of a clean towel to collect most of the secretions and keep the ET tube covered. It may be necessary to suction excessive oropharyngeal secretions. ||0

   1. The clinician should personally ensure that all monitors and alarms in the room are turned off and assign staff to override alarms that cannot be turned off if they are triggered. 
2. Remove all restraints
3. Ensure room for family/caregivers 
   1. Sufficient space around the bedside should be made available to family and caregivers. Nasogastric tubes and any other needless or disfiguring or unnecessary devices that may be crowding the bedside should be removed before the family enters the room. If the patient is an infant or young child, the parent should be allowed to hold the child. 
4. Allow family to hold patient, if child
5. Maintain IV access for palliative medicines
6. after-death care 
   1. Then pressors should then be turned off and intravenous access should be maintained for administration of palliative medications.
7. Encourage family to take the time they need with the patient 
   1. At this point, the family should be allowed to approach their loved one whose face is now no longer encumbered by medical devices. A nurse should be stationed at the opposite side of the bed with a washcloth and oral suction catheter. Tissues should be available for extra secretions, and for tears. The family should be encouraged to hold the patient's hand and provide assurances to their loved one. Administration of symptom-management medications should continue for as long as they may be needed.
8. Inform of next steps for the deceased 
   1. Offer acute grief support
   2. Offer follow up bereavement support, as appropriate 
      1. When they are ready to leave, the family should be informed about the next steps of care for patients who have died in the ED. Follow-up bereavement support should be offered in accordance with institutional policies."||0
596|572|Ensure Appropriate Orders|0|"   1. Appropriate orders for symptom relief
   2. DNR orders consistent with hospital policy
"|The emergency clinician should be prepared to write (1) appropriate orders for symptom relief and (2) a do-not-resuscitate order that is consistent with policies and procedures of the hospital. There should be a clear discussion and consensus with the patient and family about not restarting the ventilator once it is removed and about the DNR status (see also Module 4: Advance Directives). If this consensus cannot be achieved, ventilator withdrawal should be postponed. The actual withdrawal of intervention should be conducted carefully because it will probably remain in the memories of all present for a long time. Protocols for withdrawal are described below||0
